Meemaw resisted at first , but now she loves it .
I'm actually more of a theorist .
I'm not saying people can't use tools . Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam .
We , we really appreciate it .
Um .
Oh , no , no , I'm just here to get my hair cut .
Who are you calling ? Aaargh !
Oh yeah , well , you wouldn't even be nominated . Dr Gablehauser , I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run . All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock '
First of all , when you say things like that , people think you're crazy . Second , the reason I'm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman .
Uh-oh , flashlight went out . I need some batteries . Fellas ? Hello ? It's really dark down here .
Oh , good , you got my note . Penny , I'd like you to meet Tom , uh , Penny , this is Tom , Tom , may I present Penny .
What ?
Au contraire . When I correct people I am raising them up . You should know , I do it for you more than anyone .
Well , stick to your guns . There will be a lot of pressure .
Very well .
All right , this goes against everything I stand for , but desperate times call for desperate measures . Lord , this is Sheldon Cooper . You're good friends with my mom . I know I've spent my life denying that you exist .
I know that you worked hard to put this together . I'm sorry I'm ruining it .
How ?
Hey , Thursday can't get here soon enough . I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee .
I smell funny . I taste salty .
My fever is gone , my sinuses are pressure-free , and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall .
The problem appears to be unsolvable .
All right , then . Let's go to the bedroom , remove our clothes , fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking .
You know what ? This isn't gonna work .
So , in a way it's like I'm your son .
I see . Well , I think I'll be going .
No , it's too late . I see it . That elf sticker says to Sheldon . The die has been cast , the moving finger has writ , Hannibal has crossed the Alps .
I'm calling it . I won .
Leonard , don't be fooled . I'm from Texas , Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico .
Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist .
Are they making fun of us ?
Of course not . And , technically , magic beans would be food , although eating them would be quite a waste , since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk , which would provide enough roughage for a small city .
To be honest , I didn't know you were here .
Let's sit somewhere else .
I suppose it is . In fact , if you'd like to celebrate with a little music , I'd be okay with that .
I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you .
Not yet .
You want me to leave the apartment ?
Now , how's about you get us a couple of beers ?
Done .
I've decided you're right . My career is not over .
I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf . Earlier today , it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people .
Would you like some aloe vera ? You just got burned . All right , my turn . Howard , Bernadette . Daq tu taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH .
I apologize . I just , I'm plagued by an internal struggle .
There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor .
Oh , and do you remember what you said ?
I've got a treat for us tomorrow , Mom . I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology . And the best part is , at the Q and A afterward , I've worked up a couple of Q's that will stump his sorry A .
What did they feed the lions , Mother ?
Hello .
And what is that supposed to mean ?
I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you , but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship .
You don't even know what it is , do you ? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does , the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question . As I am doing so eloquently right now .
No . Isaac goes at the top of the tree .
Well , if we're going to descend into anarchy
Given this situation , I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard .
Power failure . Implementing power-failure protocol .
The motion carries . Good day , Amy Farrah Fowler .
Well , I can be helpful . Give me something to do . You know , my father took me to work once , and in ten minutes I figured out who'd been stealing from the cash register . It was my father . Yeah , Dad lost his job , but Mr . Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle .
Oh , baguettes . Yes , I like baguettes . What exactly are you doing ?
A cross we all must bear . You know , in difficult moments like this , I often turn to a force greater than myself .
I'm not sure of the protocol . Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch , but of the two of us , you're clearly more sofa-sized .
Not Sunday , I love Sunday .
Hey look , now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia , but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist .
I left them in the bowl .
Are you just getting home ?
What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw , overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power .
Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property , or chattels , is transferred from one person , the bailor , to another person , the bailee .
At the movies , Wolowitz always eats Raisinets .
But , look , an optical transient .
Yeah , you know what's not normal ? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show . Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag . Yeah , good luck , you crazy Kiwis , we're rooting for you .
Yes .
You saw through that one , did you ?
Literally ? Literally a million years ?
How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher ? You were wonderful . A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory . Who couldn't relate to that ?

To a hospital ? Full of sick people ? Oh , I don't think so .
No . I don't believe you . I could tell .
You're right , That was uncalled for . I take it back .
Play . Play . Play . Play . Play .
I knew it .
Don't you need money ?
Yeah , well , no , not to them . To me . Time traveling mailbox . The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet .
ldon : We might as well settle it now , it's going to be on for years . Initial here . All right , that's television and movies . Section nine , miscellany . The apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure .
Except you identified me , your best friend , as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away . The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex .
Well , of course you are . Who else would you take ?
Well , now , but do you think that's a good idea ? Uh , you know Star Trek . Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition ?
All right .
So , how was your date ?
Well , don't get me wrong . Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff . But , you know , when it connects to physics , gas up the Ford , Martha , we're going for a drive .
Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm .
FYI , my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night .
Shh , we're trying to watch the movie . This is not working out with him .
You didn't break up , she dumped you .
It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings . Feynman , Einstein , Professor X . Humorously , in the case of Professor X , some of his students actually had wings . That's rich . I'll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm .
I was going to make you red zinger , but since Mars is the red planet , I went with peppermint .
I can't shoot now , I'm cloaking .
Uh , mariachi bands , wild dogs , beans that jump around ' cause there's a worm inside .
Bazinga . I don't care .
It's a common mistake .
Even though the menu description specifies shredded ?
Not to tell anyone .
Of course .
My good sir , we are neither crackpots nor wannabes . In fact , we are experts in our fields . And while you hide behind your anonymity , we stand behind our paper . And later tonight , your mother .
So , how's Koothrappali d ' . oh my Lord .
Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis ?
The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room . Mwah , ha , ha .
Use new eggs .
If I did , would I find any ?
2311 North Los Robles Avenue , Pasadena , California to International Space Station . Can you read me ? Over .
Oh , Penny , I see you've ordered pizza . I have Chinese food .
You didn't really type .
Oh . Well , I thought we were going in order .
That's it . We're done with the questions .
Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here ?
Yes ?
Oh , no , he's not uncomfortable at all . No , he's loving it . Yeah , he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six .
Other than the lack of water , how is it not ?
Oh , Lord , will this day never end ? As I've explained repeatedly to Dr . Koothrappali , whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient , there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture .
Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle .
Top desk drawer .
Yeah , okay , I can see you're going to take this the wrong way . Let me try again . Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps .
Walking away .
If you say so , boss .
I still don't care .
Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch ?
ldon : Never fly it upside down unless the apartment's in distress . And next , if either of us ever invents time travel , we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds .
I'll start you off easy . Electric eel , pufferfish , shrimp .
Of course I understand . And who are you to tell me about outer space ?
Leonard , lots of people could've had that idea , but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did .
It's perfect . It appears romantic , but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever .
It wasn't funny .
That's not true . Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time .
If that's Morse code , that's terrible . As I was saying , you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter . Earlier this evening , Leonard characterized it as just fine . So what you're seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed .
No , I'm not okay . Uh , I'm wearing borrowed pants , I don't have I . D . , and one of the officers here won't stop calling me chicken legs .
Okay . I have guests coming . I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now .
Must be out of range .
Oh , good Lord . Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock ?
Oh , you'd like to catch up on the events of the day . All right . Well , there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box , I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems , and , oh , yes , in a moment filled with biblical resonance , pride wenteth before my fall , causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz .
Not important . Your sugar was a little high . I'd follow up with your regular physician . In the meantime , I have some paperwork here for you to go over .
She is . But when do they get to the part about streetcars ?
Seriously . I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis .
All right , we've defeated the first challenge . Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate .
But candles ? During a blackout ? Are you mad ? That's a fire hazard . No , Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick .
That's just the beginning . I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company . Oh , glow in the dark tampons ! Leonard , we're going to be rich .
Is he making any progress ? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil .
Right . 22 .
I'm sorry you had to go through that .
Yes . I've decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom , including spiking the punch .
You distract me . I've been distracted since the moment I met you .
Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it !
Damn you , walletnook.com .
Oh , good , Stuart , I thought I heard your voice . Do you have a moment ?
If I remember correctly , Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3 , which will be January 10
A girls night ? Oh , I don't know if I'm up for an evening talking about rainbows , unicorns and menstrual cramps .
She's not my girlfriend .
She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve . I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them . That's when Amy said , want to make this interesting ?
Howard , could you lower the lights ? I have a short PowerPoint presentation .
Wolowitz might hand out cigars . I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish .
Hello . I'm Dr . Sheldon Cooper , and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents : Fun With Flags . You may notice that I'm holding a remote control . That's because my cameraperson and co-host , Dr . Amy Farrah Fowler , has chosen to end her relationship with me . I'm going to pause here to let that sink in . Okay . If you need to pause a little longer , just click the pause button . But the show must go on . And thankfully , all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand . Anyway , let's not spend any more time talking about her . We're here to talk about flags . Tonight's theme , flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible .
Thank you so much . I can't believe you're '
That's the wrong box . Put it back .
I can't think of a reason why not .
We locked eyes , I ran to my room , and we never , ever spoke of it .
Are you in danger ?
The original title was ' A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism ' I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch .
Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines .
Oh , hi Penny . FYI , the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only , and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I'd avoid using that for your delicates .
Tell me what ?

I know , and Amy says I can't have a train room .
Excuse me . I have to break up with my girlfriend .
That's because he drinks too much soy milk .
Oh , that sounds terrible . Why would I want to do that ?
That's a big step .
You saw nothing !
And I could not have done it without you .
Yes . Since their relationship became carnal , Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment , thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie , usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult .
Well , there's nothing embarrassing about that , your father worked with Lewis Leakey , a great anthropologist . It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting .
Not Penny , me !
Yes , it is .
What's odd is they're in the trash can .
You know what I'm going to do ? I am going to sit here and just let them stew .
Why ?
If you intend to pursue Amy , you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it .
Professor Rothman . This isn't your office any more . You're retired .
Yes . Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels .
I am not guilty . I only have a learner's permit , Penny was the teacher . When the light turned yellow she said go , go , go , so I went , went , went .
Excuse me . This is not about protecting my friend . I'm a big fan of homeostasis . Do you know what that is ?
It's all right .
Wait ! Where are you going ? Penny , come back ! I'll get you ice cream !
Texas .
Well , then , it's settled ?
Meemaw . I'm so happy to see you .
Gentlemen , I know we said we'd take turns , but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here .
I will admit nothing of the sort . And now if you'll excuse me , I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped .
Hello .
Thank you .
Yes , that good news .
Oh , that's a paradox . I mean if you meant what you just said , then that means you may not have meant what you just said .
Great . New topic . Where are you in your menstrual cycle ?
Defcon 5 ? Well , there's no need to rush .
That's how my father always began our football conversations . And if you'd like , after the game , I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself .
I wish you could all be inside my head . The conversation is sparkling .
Well , not just him . May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker , beater , chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team .
I tried to scare an Indian with a snake . Come on , Cooper . You're better than this .
Hold on . You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move , and then he only need buy us a pizza ?
I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt .
Yes .
Howard ?
You don't shove them . They come with an easy-glide applicator .
Let's see . What's next ? Oh , kissing's romantic .
You're good-naturedly ribbing me , aren't you ?
I don't follow .
Fine . As you know , I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday . Every year we'd have a party . No one I invited would ever come , because they didn't like me .
Why on earth are you telling me all this ?
Oh , friggety-frak . Not this again .
I don't want another parking space . I want my parking space . It's perfect . It's a corner spot , cutting the risk of door-dings in half . It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance . The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel . Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks .
Uh , one question about that picture . Can it be with George Lucas ? Ooh , grumpy you are .
Yeah , we'll do it in two . Hi . I'm Dr . Sheldon Cooper . I'm the actual brains behind this project . Also , engineers aren't real scientists , MIT's a trade school , and the Death Star is from Star Wars , not Star Trek . But otherwise , thank you for your service .
Well , what if it's his only way out ? I can't risk it . Here is twelve dollars . Now , we're even . Wait , wait , wait , I bought a card . Give me two dollars . And for the record , this is why I hate gift-giving .
Oh , I don't know , uh , weather , uh , fish you could do carpentry with , why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend . Yeah , pick one , your choice .
Amy , may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate ?
Good one . And an electrical charge .
Gentlemen , is anybody interested in my old string theory books ?
Rotating .
Great . Now Mandarin .
That's very hurtful .
Now , are you sure ? Everyone's smoking them . I think they're the best .
Hey , hey . She's mine , take a cold shower , grandpa .
Actually , I'm paraphrasing . Having been raised in a Christian household , I'm uncomfortable with the language he used . And to be honest , I'm not entirely comfortable with cockamamie .
So to answer your question , no , it's not better .
You were .
Nine .
No , I will be Uncle Dr . Cooper .
All righty .
Mmmmm !
You didn't mention Leonard .
Cause of accident , lack of adhesive ducks . Okay , medical history . Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes ?
Who knows ? I haven't watched any scary movies recently . I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe . And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull .
Uh , uh , I couldn't help but notice that you cut the line .
I'm sorry , Leonard , this is Toby Loobenfeld , he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab , but he also minored in theatre at MIT .
Oh . I guess I'm a special boy . You know , sometimes when a boy is special , he gets a Fudgsicle . Which , by the way , tastes like the speed of light .
Zack .
I'm sorry . But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde ?
Are you sure ? ' Cause I'm feeling a twinge .
And that's how it's done .
Leonard , please , we can talk during our break . We have one coming up at midnight . We'll need snacks .
No , he doesn't understand . I understand .
I did .
Well , it better not be more than a thousand dollars . That's all I've got on me .
Would you like to see my cats ?
The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me ?
Ach , why not ? We're already through the looking glass anyway .
Oh , that's clever .
It's too late for Koothrappali . Let's go .
Wait . Excuse me . You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger , barbecue sauce , bacon and cheese on the side .
What do you mean ?
All right .

To the comic book store . You're probably thinking , the comic book store ? On a Thursday ? Why , I've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness . What you have failed to take into account , Penny , is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday .
Yeah , maybe you better , I took a pretty big sip .
No . This is . Stop looking at my legs .
Oh , I see . Penny , I'm not sure I'm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation .
My apologies . I chose my words poorly . I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch . Anyway , thank you for watching it . It's one of my all-time favourites .
Do you people even hear yourselves ? It's not the Wesley Crushers . It's not the ' Wesley Crushers . It's the Wesley ' Crushers . '
I can't sleep . how are you going ?
And I call her Meemaw because , well , just , well , look at her .
So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet ?
That's all right . I can barely hear you over my theremin .
And that didn't work out , did it ?
Leonard's right . We can't just jump ahead . We have to watch the whole movie .
In case either of you have larceny in your heart , you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can .
I wasn't talking to you .
Sarcasm ?
With or without a numbing agent ?
Great restraint on my part .
Yes .
I'm on vacation . What do you think ?
Oh , I've heard of that place , isn't that Pasadena's favourite Irish watering hole .
Yes , exactly .
I did learn how to swim .
Huh . Yeah , I always took it literally . That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant . Hmm .
I told you not to get the surgery .
You can't live here .
Really ? That seems rather short sighted , coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable . Why don't you take some time to reconsider ?
But you've been engaged for over a year now , and you don't even have a wedding date .
I've got the Sword of Azeroth !
Delighted ? What . , not if I guessed for a hundred years .
It's a Pok'mon reference .
Wait ! Leonard ! Wait ! What am I going to do for dinner ?
You appear to have put your car key in the door lock , are you aware of that ?
I can't believe I didn't bring my gieger counter . You know , I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it .
Forgive me , Penny , but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit .
I am asserting , in the event that Batman's death proves permanent , that original Robin , Dick Grayson , is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl .

Point of order . I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous . No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger , when common sense dictates it should be an army ant .
This is disconcerting .
Oh , maybe you're right . He is kind of a lump .
I've done no stupid things .
My apologies . What's your plan .
Very well . Things between you and Penny have never been better . I hope four months apart doesn't change anything . I should have opened with that , huh ?
That's the best part , you don't have to , see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed , if you knew that she found out that you had lied , so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force .
Oh , I'm going with it . Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015 . That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff . Therefore , the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac . And not just never gets . Never have , never hasn't , never had have hasn't .
What's up ? I'll tell you what's up . I'm in a crisis situation , and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration , limited as they may be '
Keep the table . We don't use that space .
And Raj .
Simultaneously , a festival of cloying clich
Oh ! I love trains !
Oh , I understand the confusion . I have never said that you are not good at what you do . It's just that what you do is not worth doing .
It actually says at least ?
In the pre-Christian era , as the winter solstice approached and the plants died , pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic , intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring . This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree .
Well , sure .
Not true . The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically . Instead of fleeing , he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family . Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA ?
Uh , I'm going to draw you a soothing bath . Where's your bath thermometer ?
Good night . I'm sorry . This is really important .
I was going to . I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday .
Yeah , and on top of that , Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged , he may not want to live with me any more .
Why ?
Not my fault . You said there'd be other scientists there my age .
You guys are the worst . Thank you , I think that was helpful .
I can't tell you that . I am bound by closet organizer / organizee confidentiality .
Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute . FYI , my mother's birthday is coming up . I'm going to need you to pick up a present .
Well , my new shoes are not made for running .
Hey ! He did that on purpose ,
Okay , point . What sort of foundation do you have ? Did you take any science classes in school ?
Okay . Wait , hang on . Bladder check . We're good to go .
Excuse me . I didn't authorize this .
Get it together , man .
I need to speak to you .
Correct . You're not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery .
We could . We could also stop using the letter M , but I think that idea is isguided and oronic .
Well , given my history on the subject , t seems a little reckless to bring it up now .
Not my problem . I just don't understand how this happened to me . I'm scrupulous about my hygiene . I regularly disinfect my hands , and I avoid contact with other people on general principle .
Can't sleep ?
Wait , wait . Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol .
Okay . That was tricky , ' cause when it comes to alcohol , she generally means business .
I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub .
It's slowing down .
Don't be silly . I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact .
Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are , for all intents and purposes , deceased . He intends to act on this by not speaking to you , feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence .
Oh , hello , everyone . I am happy to report I'm feeling much better .
I need eggs . Four dozen should suffice .
I've heard enough . Sit over there .
Impressive .
His statements of the obvious continue to annoy .
Ah , gentlemen , what is on the conversational menu this morning ?
Ooh , perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation .
Oh , sure . And while we're at it , why don't we put our hands behind our backs , have an old-fashioned eating contest ?
Leonard , friends are like toilet paper . It's good to have extras under the sink .
It's actually based on very sound theories , his mother published a paper on it .
A second what ? Pair of underwear ?
I suppose I could if I were asked .
Yes , yes , you were busy , you were surprised , all very fascinating . Now where do we stand on the freezer ?
Thank you . Ira , if I may , I'd like to apologize for my behaviour last week .
Howard , did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour ?
Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can't Spy ? It's all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum .
So , can you help me ?
Oh , okay , okay , calm down .
Really ?
Hmm , let me think . Nothing . I'm a delight .
Hang on . Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room , it is a snowy tree cricket .
Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion ?
Let's try just walking out .
Hello , 2003 .
So , I'm thinking , you won the Nobel Prize what , three years ago ? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately ? My thought is we continue my research as a team , you know , Cooper-Smoot , alphabetical , and when we win the Nobel Prize , you'll be back on top .
Oh , not at all . I've had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening , and , oh , I had lunch
I'm sorry .
I'm getting three trains .
Yeah , and you're still eating our food .
Three months . This is gonna be great !
You're right , of course .
Just because I am easily bothered by light , heat , sound , smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I'm sensitive .
Thank you for driving me to work .
A machine that reads emotions is intriguing . It could help me be a more considerate friend .
Mom smokes in the car . Jesus is okay with it , but we can't tell Dad .
Of course not . Even in my sleep-deprived state , I've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks . Bazinga !
Oh , dear , Mr . D'Onofrio's in the hospital . Why do these things always happen to me ?
Today , it's a Chinese food retrieval robot . Tomorrow , it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor .
You know , I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative , but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn .
Oh , Doctor Hofstadter , it's so good to see you again .
Although , a few minutes ago would have been better .
Oh , I don't know . But whoever that mystery man was , you should be eternally grateful , for without him , there would be no Leonard's Day .
Aaah !
Dare I say loco ? Oh , and , Amy , guess what ? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work , he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us .
No . No , I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life . I'm going to need a ride to the mall .
The answer's tricky . It's Second Street . You see , you'd think it would be First Street , but in most towns , First Street eventually gets renamed to something else , you know , like Main Street , Broad Street , Michigan Avenue . Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that . We also play games . Would you like to play one ?
But . Oh , this changes everything .
We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities .
Yeah , that list is strong . Like your mother's urge to be promiscuous with sailors .
Oh , hello , Amy .
Oh-ho ! Really ? Well here's another nit for you . The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene .
Pretty sure's not very scientific , is this how you normally work , just hunches and guesses and stuff ?
No you didn't .
Oh I do like monkeys !

They took my battle ostrich .
All right , so technically it's not a dinner date . I suppose you could call it a , uh , dinfast date . But if you did , you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking , such as , Hey , Leonard , how was your dinfast with Priya last night ?
I'm the boss . I make the jokes .
Oh good grief .
Even the girls .
I see . Is that decision open for discussion ?
Well , it is . If I wanted to hold three things at once , I'd wear cargo pants .
To what ?
Very well . Would you be interested in knowing that Mr . Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level - 80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor ?
I have troubles , Penny . I've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep .
You can't . If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past , you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it , ergo you would still have it . This is a classic rookie time travel mistake .
I'm sorry , who's Angie Dickinson ?
Ooh , we already have our first call .
Well , whatever it is , it agrees with you .
All right , everyone pay attention . Yes , I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler . Yes , she is female . Yes , we communicate on a daily basis , but no , she is not my girlfriend .
Yes . If you'd like to join in , the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure .
Well , not with that attitude .
Put it on the back burner . Anyway , it occurs to me , if I ever did perfect a time machine , I'd just go into the past and give it to myself , thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place .
All right . This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard's bedroom . Sign here , indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression .
What if I choke on my popcorn , who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre .
Hmm ? Oh , I did . It hasn't stopped . I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants .
A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy . Oh , I don't care for this at all . Oh , I need to see he's okay .
By the way , how are you with zippers ?
2530 East Andy Devine Avenue ,
Excuse me , but the sun is essential for all life on Earth . Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat . A crime , by the way , for which he is never brought to account .
Who's ready to laugh ?
Good news , gentlemen , I have tentatively accepted '
Yeah , I have to say , I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition . Apparently , there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop .
Not for me . Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night . Tonight's selection , brussels sprouts .
I saved a nun's life . Why am I being punished ?
I'm sorry . We just need a word .
Penny ?
Well , at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her , and analyse the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again .
Well , I had just begun puberty . It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life .
The earliest estimate of the singularity , when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality .
Yes ?
No !
Not quite accurate . The Macy's balloons are filled with helium , whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane .
Are you ill ?
Oh , dear !
Hit it .
Okay , this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned , you need to give them a chance to
Did you once again ignore your check engine light ?
I was being sarcastic .
People don't go in my room !
He's not a barber , he's the nephew . He's an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry . Besides , Mr . D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas .
I was giving clear , concise orders .
Oh , I'm aware . It features Whoopi Goldberg . She played Guinan on Star Trek : Next Gen . Penny , Next Gen refers to Star Trek '
It was tornado season . And it was an aluminium house . Anyway , the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English , when I finally managed to convince her I was sick , she said '
Knock-knock .
No .
Oh , dear Lord , a police officer's glancing in our direction . We've been made .
Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow .
Oh , yes . In fact , I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion . You bowl like your mama . Unless , of course , she bowls well . In which case , you bowl nothing like her .
What ?
Actually , it turns out I can .
Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned . Tonight , we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure , Zork . It's the buggy beta version .
How can you be late , I wasn't expecting you at all .
Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small , oddly-shaped man ?
You know , I'm not sure . You know , you'd have to ask him . Excuse me .
Oh ! No , she's right , I don't need to know what you were doing . Carry on .
Glad .
Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation ? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me .
Wonderful . Now , what about Euler-Lagrange theorems ?
But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump .
Yeah , I know , top ten , pretty exciting .
Well , that's it then . I'm dead .
I thought you were leaving the apartment .
I'd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis .
Why are you waving a white flag ?
Maybe it's just something minor . Ooh , good news , the light just went out .
That's a Raging Ogre .
But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career , a popular Internet show , and a girlfriend .
Arthur ?
I know how to get the bucket ! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it . Let's see . Go north . You are in a forest . Go north . You are in a forest . Go north . You are in a forest . Oh dear , I believe I'm lost . Well , I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow .
I don't think there's anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears .
ldon : Last question . In a post-apocalyptic world , which task would you assign the highest priority ? Locating a sustainable food source , re-establishing a functioning government , procreating , or preserving the knowledge of mankind ?
Howard ?
In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me , he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo .
The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other .
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen .
Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour ?
Who's in the mood to laugh ?
All right , pencils down ! I have lokh , makh , and cherrrkh . Anybody got those ?
Or caffeine , tobacco , sushi , soft cheese , processed meats and jacuzzis , which can all be harmful to an unborn baby .
Not at all .
Penny .
Wonderful . Dinner , some assembly required .
All right . It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece '
Hello .
366 367 '
Okay . I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time , I just had to be sure .
Bert ? I wanted to let you know that I read your research , and your award is well-deserved .
Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich .
Leonard , you're my best friend . Why don't you ever take my side ?
I was enjoying some virtual reality , until you ruined it with your actual face .
You're happy with who you are . You don't get jealous of other people . Instead of being weighed down by ambition , you just float along like a dead body in a river .
Been there .
Sorry ? I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old .
According to the roommate agreement , paragraph nine , subsection B , the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure . And believe me , I am experiencing a very majeure force .
I know . You know , I almost died in a fire in Des Moines , but I stayed put . FYI , that's when the Imodium gave out .
That depends . When I learn that I'm a robot , will I be able to handle it ?
Oh , very much so . Listen to this . This is from two days ago . Hi . Hope you're having a good day . Who has time for this constant sexting ?
Well , maybe what's in my pants will change your mind . It's a list of this year's panelists . It's long , isn't it ?
The dice giveth and the dice taketh away .
I was not aware of that .
I see . Is that all right ? I'm sorry , but this is a litigious society . I'm gonna need verbal consent .
Oh , boy , if there is one thing that gets my goat , it's those dad-gum insurance companies .
I spoke to the reporter at the magazine .
I'm sorry , that's not going to interest me at all , just eat .
You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise . Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting .
Outdoor ? Oh . I can RSVP no right now .
What ?
Wow , no foreplay or anything , just right to it .
He said start with it , not end with it .
Ah . New topic . Women , delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy ?
Wait , where are you going ?
Well then , no problem , I have three controllers , the more the merrier .
This is a Jewish house . I don't think they have pigskin .
You're preaching to the choir , sister .
Who's Adam West ? Leonard , what do the two of you talk about after the coitus ?
Wait , hang on . You've spent time with Amy . Can you think of anything she's fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed ?
This is the swampland of Dagobah . It's where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi .
Oh , I can help you with that . Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen . While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket .
Considering what ? How great this place looks ?
You're making it difficult to love you right now .
My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday . She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on . And by the way , the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer .
So , I win .
Glad you asked . As I see it , there's a simple solution . Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman . It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship , you should find another man and dally with him . And by dally , I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action .
Oh , then I'm out .
Amy's right . He is tedious .
And you did it so casually , no rapid breathing , no increase in perspiration .
As your friend , let's hope it doesn't come to that . Please sign .
Of course it was . The whole plan reeks of Leonard .
What do you want , Barry ?
I know why . You've come to me because you're my Obi-Wan .
Dungeons & Dragons .
A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment .
You made God sad today , Mom .
Oh , Lord , you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell . At Stan Lee's house . We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee .
Whatever it is , we know his life will never be the same .
It's eleven am .

You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain ? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos . And they'd offer to toast it for me , too .
But this is my birthday suit . Are you having a stroke ? Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party .
That's a good idea . I guess everyone's having them now .
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled . But not as big .
No , you weren't listening . She said , it's not what it looks like .
Amazing , an intelligent labradoodle .
Not as relieved as I'm about to be . It's a brave new world , little lady .
Excuse me , Leonard .
Oh , yes . Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas . Cats , however , refuse to wear sporting apparel . My sister found that out the hard way .
I guess . Don't worry , I was going to order you cheeseless .
Ugh , this again . Amy , I've already had one new hole torn in my body today . I don't need another one .
Oh , not just something , no . It's from the heart , it's holiday-themed , and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it .
Hardly .
Well , oh , it's just a , it's a , a golf ball that my brother threw at my head . You can still feel the dent . It's right next to the hockey puck dent .
Yes , you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems . It used to be me . Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble . Anyway , I'm sorry for everything . Oh , and FYI , if you cry while they're fighting , they'll take you to McDonald's .
Can you drive me to Pottery Barn ?
His name isn't Toby . Toby is an absurd name for a cricket .
They're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for , nor the ability to use umbrellas .
You don't think that crosses a line ?
It's a billion dollar idea . Shhhhh !
With you ?
Yes , you are . I'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns .
Okay , here .
Oh , good , my turn . Well , this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know '
Okay . What is your game ?
Oh . Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing ?
That presupposes Penny is tense .
No , I suppose not .
I knew she wasn't lead car material .
As a child , I loved Wesley Crusher , Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek . So , I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear , so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed . But he never showed , because apparently , it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares . Oh , damn ! The floppy failed . Well , whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989 , congratulations , you just made the list .
Yes . The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds .
I resent you saying we don't have company .
Bye .
Why ?
Really ? You know I don't like buying things at night . January 7th , 2009 , I went to the Ralph's at 11:30 pm to pick up Cracklin Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see ?
I admire you , Leonard .
It's partially torn off , but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U .
I don't know . Lately we've been talking about converting it into a missile silo .
But I came to file a complaint . Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature .
Oh , if you want to get in on the pool , you're too late . All the squares have been purchased .
Hello .
Bye . Oh , good news , gentlemen . Amy's at a conference this weekend , which means I'm available to be entertained , hmm . As today's youth might put it , who wants to get their Sheld-on ?
Oh . Uh , no , no , no , thank you .
Remember , seven o'clock .
Yeah , not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory . That's pure Cooper .
Again , time machine .
I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick .
Penny , a moment . We just had Thai food . In that culture , the last morsel is called the krengjai piece , and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group .
Curiouser and curiouser .
But I used science to construct the perfect joke .
That would be acceptable . On Mondays , I eat Thai food . Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace .
Based on what happened next , I assume it means ' would you like an enema ? '
Sorry I'm moving slowly .
You know , frankly , I'd prefer a sex tape .
That's Princess Punchali .
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely .
Where's Stuart ?
Soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur . Happy kitty , sleepy kitty , purr , purr , purr .
Leonard , where are you ?
I have some odd freckles on my buttocks . Can I make an appointment for you to look at them ?
All right , now I'm starting to sense a little tension .
Ah , it's basic thermodynamics . I'm sure we can figure that out .
The resemblance is remarkable . I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair .
Yep , I'm on it . Hey , look at that , an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella .
Well , so far , I've come up with three ideas . The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L . A . Philharmonic .
Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going ?
Ah , the talking cure . Classical Freudian , good choice . If it will help speed things along , uh , my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A , a bat , B , a bat , C , a bat , and D , my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle .
Mm-hmm .
Your driving , the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities , your constant tardiness , your singing .
I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location .
Neither do I , but it's the social convention .
Interesting . A friendly sentiment in this country , cruel taunt in the Sudan . It's a lesson in context .
That's not true .
Penny , rub Vicks on my chest .
I'll admit that was a concern . But the fact is , I'll need a support team . And the three of you are my first choice .
In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a '
Excuse me . It's Major Sheldon Cooper . With my last breath , I awarded myself a battlefield promotion . It's kind of a big deal .
I don't know . I am really aggravated .
Before you say yes , it's not the movie about the big dog .
Oh , I'm fine . It's just some , uh , stomach medication for my trip . There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America .
Oh , come on . Who hasn't seen this differential below ' here I sit broken hearted ? '
It was . And even though we're not allowed back there , they can never take today away from us . Unlike my sense of smell , which hasn't returned since the Tasing . No , I got nothing .
Oh , it's fine . You needed a suitcase , I wasn't home , you borrowed a suitcase .
Really . Talk to me about that pocket watch .
Oh . Well , that's all right . There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented .
Oh , that seems overly harsh . I mean , you gave in to a human weakness , you didn't kill a man . You know , it's a tad old-school , but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey .
You remember my mother .
When does a monkey have a trunk ?
I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops . It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops .
It was pretty easy . And I think my background in mathletics helped . Barry Kripke was there . I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out .
Don't read those letters !
May I come in ?
Morning .
So , there are fresh linens on the bed and , oh , well , now , I see you've met Theodore . Theodore , these are your new room mates , Leonard and Penny . They're very honest , but I would not leave cash lying around .
I was going to mention it at the time , but then I thought , some day , this might be a teachable moment .
From the mind that brought you hi-lo . Let me show you to your room .
Yes . If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window . Please don't come to my funeral . Have a good night .
Wait . How do I know that you're not manipulating me right now ?
It'd be swell if they had a train .
Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors - lizard-Spock moment .
Helping anyone . People should take care of themselves .
Oh , I didn't think of Iron Man . You know , maybe after myself and I have dinner , we can meet you two for dessert .
Age is a state of mind , Leonard . In here I'm 90 . Why are you taking your bins over there ?
I'll have a diet coke .
Yes , there are .
Like what ?
What are you doing ? Two fifty is already the discounted price .
It's a snake . A terrifying snake .
Possibly , but unverified .
We had a difference of opinion .
Actually , yes . I do .
Terrific , you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future .
Okay . So , Feynman , Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar . Feynman says , it appears
It's a small price to pay .
I'm confused . If there's no costume parade , what are we doing here ?
Are you sure ? These items represent our shared times together .
I am .
Oh , no , he's drinking it .
Ay-yi-yi .
It's magnificent . This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever .
Wait a minute . I know this may sound far fetched , but I'm on the market now . You know , if I dated Mandy , that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson .
Do I say stop what , or just throw in the towel ?
It's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one .
They should . It's one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival .
How dare you ?
You're right . You're right . Got it . We order calzones , cut them open , eat them like pizza . All right , all right , I'll shake the brain bush one more time , see what falls out . Got it . There's a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings .
Hmm .
No . I wanted to surprise her . What am I supposed to say to her after something like this ?
I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female . You have none .
Boy , some people are just glass-half-empty .
Or the one . Dammit , I'll do it .
Oh , Tesla .
Point taken . You may want to sit up .
Well , the evidence does support that .
It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials . So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand . Put ' er there , you old so-and-so .
And you said the party starts at seven .
I'm concerned about Amy . She's acting a bit odd lately .
All right . Leonard fairly calls the question , who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him ? Say hi to Kurt for us .
The online game ? Bully !
Yeah , well , he does know his stuff .
I'm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate , so that I can move on from string theory .
It's me , Sheldon , Mrs . Wolowitz .

Oh . All right . I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex .
Get ? Hang on . I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously .
As I've stated before on numerous occasions , the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken , because the last words I would hear are ' Release the Kraken . That never gets old . ' Release the Kraken ! Oh , chills . Besides , I'm having dinner with Amy .
You think you don't care ?
Hey , it's not even called the Genius Grant , it's the MacArthur Fellowship . Just like it's not Frankenstein , it's Frankenstein's Monster . Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there . And if anyone's a genius , it's me for the way I brought that full circle .
So , you see it too .
Homesick is a type of being sick .
No , I am not saying that , because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that .
For the record , I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto ?
Not so fast . You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli , Penny .
Well , actually , insects are a dietary staple in many cultures , they're almost pure protein .
It's called non-fiction for a reason , Leonard .
I don't see how you could .
Rats .
Hello . I'm here for my haircut with Mr . D'Onofrio .
Yes . Bazinga . Leonard ?
Oh . Oh , I'm sorry . Correction , that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert , she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done . That better ?
This is kind of creepy .
Your clothes ?
Amy , from time to time , we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves .
I'll tell you why . Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me , so now I'm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that .
That seems acceptable .
It's not fair . Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands .
Hold on . Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209 ?
Have fun presenting my lucky hunch .
See ? That's what I thought . But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer .
But we did convince him to leave the motel . Come say hello . Leo , this is Penny , our friend and neighbour .
And Amy doesn't look sick .
How late ?
It's a terrific book . I've distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process .
Leonard , please , let me go .
Just breaking in your new car .
It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing , I skipped kindergarten .
Hey , I hate to break up the party , but Amy says I'm tired and have to go to bed .
It doesn't matter what I want . It's your birthday , you decide .
Uh , but this is violating university code .
That's a bit childish , isn't it ?
What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab ?
No . I quit .
You didn't let me finish . Dinfast
If I may speak for Comic-Con , we don't want that either .
I'm sneaking into work . Now , if the guard at the university asks what's under the blanket , you tell him it's some lobster traps .
I hope you're happy making me read this . Bert's work is remarkable , and I'm more upset than ever . This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining .
Yes , we skyped this morning and I'm sure I'll check in with her before I go to sleep .
Oh .
Well , until they invent nose condoms , I'm not finding out .
Well , no wonder the women are winning .
But they're not blonde , so put on your wig . Hello ?
Yes , I've moved to a four-napkin system . Lap , hands , face and personal emergencies . If you like , starting tomorrow , I'll add a guest napkin , but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today .
Thank you . Have you chosen one to copulate with ?
You're right . Nice going .
He's in the laundry room now . Now would be a good time .
But I designed it .
I was a handful .
Got it .
Well , I'm from Texas and you're from India , we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit . Next .
Well , my mother's been there for every honour I've won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy . How does this look ?
When I rise to power , those people will be sterilized .
Yeah , It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes .
I wronged Howard , and he won't accept my apology .
Wait , just to clarify . When you get to three , do we stand up or do we pee ?
I am not trying to get her back . But , out of curiosity , what is a way ?
Although , sometimes , she omits the veil entirely .
Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs , they are no more alike than any other siblings .
I don't understand .
Amy , after consideration , I believe we may have acted rashly . I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences .
Hello . I'm Doctor Sheldon Cooper , and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags , the final episode flagtacular . I knew it was coming . Still scary . Now , I'm sure you're thinking , the final episode ? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance ?
Very well , I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch .
And boring , her words .
You violated the sanctity of my mouth .
Yes , in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it .
You don't think that will be awkward ?

I do . And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn't at his bedside to say I told you so .
Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone .
Thank you .
I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain .
I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug .
You're driving me to the mall . I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking .
ldon : Third barrier passed . You have won the right to see your room . Huzzah !
Brimstone .
Oh , of course . An nondescript , white panel van . You may be familiar with it from the sentence , their bodies were found in a nondescript , white panel van .
Forgive me , as you know , I'm no adept at reading facial cues , but I'm going to take a stab here , you're either sad or nauseated .
Yes ?
So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox , the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself ?
How dare the university force me to go back to string theory ?
It was a lot more than that . You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions , and you pumiced my hammer toe . How can I ever repay you ?
Yes , well , I'm the Doppler Effect .
Oh , let me just get one thing . It's my backup emergency supply kit . The living room escape route doesn't pass through here . Now , good night . And if there's an apocalypse , good luck .
Glory be to Heaven , some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air . George , put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin no one , and get your shotgun !
Apparently , you can't hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother .
You are ignoring the square-cube law . The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton . And for the record , the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack , hoverboard , transporter , Batmobile , and then giant ant .
You do ?
So , that's all you've got ? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne ?
Penny , just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence .
You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work .
Hi .
I've got to go with Leonard on this . He is wrong more than anyone I know .
Is it ?
Oh , please . Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips .
Oh , okay , well then , calm down .
It was obviously effective , Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist . Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it .
Listen to this . I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton . Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away . It's about Mr . Spock and his impact on our culture .
Of course I do . My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder , Colorado . It's accurate to one tenth of a second . But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical .
I've been meaning to ask you , do you think we should make a call about that ?
What insult ?
I can't believe I read this table wrong . I blame you .
No , but that list was sounding a little thin .
I was going to get my mail .
And you're wrong about Hinduism and cows .
Who haven't learned their place yet .
What are you smiling at ?
Are you sure . There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk . For example , I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time .
You want me to read a geology paper ?
Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton ?
Oh , Leonard , you know I can't do that .
As do I .

Oh , gentlemen .
Okay , there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try , but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead , their brain chemistry is far closer to ours .
If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that .
I'm not afraid to be alone . On land . On the sea , it would be terrifying . Because of all the drowning .
I know . They probably shouldn't sell those to children .
Confound it ! You're right , it's brilliant . Let's take it from the top .
Yeah ? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive ?
Leonard disproved my element . Now all the attention is going to go away .
Yes , and be sure and put on the emergency brake . Really makes these things tough to budge .
I'm okay . I'm okay . I'm not okay .
Who wrote that ?
I sincerely hope so .
Ooh , I don't think so . No , anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors , players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 % of the time due to the limited number of outcomes . I suggest rock-paper-scissors - lizard-Spock .
It's the Chinese restaurant all over again . I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men , each attempting to dance with 67 % of a woman .
Don't be absurd . That's in Washington . You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern . No . I'm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task , freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem .
Very mature . You're lucky I'm out of silly string . As I was saying , Leonard , you'll never guess who I just found online . Professor Proton .
Fine .
If you're having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato , or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology .
How would I know ? I'm not listening to you .
Really ? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $ 200million government projects on distant planets ?
What took you so long ?
Its weight and smoothness , along with the slight concavity of the mirror , means it can spin for a long time .
No , the Flash shirt is because it's Friday , but it's nice when things work out . Where's your heart rate monitor ?
Of course I do .
Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity ? I did that one summer . Ah , youth .
Aw .
I see . And is that open for discussion ?
She broke up with me .
Well , A , comic books employ storytelling through sequential art , a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux , and B , you play the harp . Like that's cool .
Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie .
I expected to see Howard throw the baseball , finish my hot dog , and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade .
Oh , I love brain teasers .
Well , I'm not using my nipples , either . Maybe they should reassign those .
I will tell you what is happening . I am saving my best friend's marriage .
Thank you . And slam it hard , because I am pretty steamed .
That depends , how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder ?
Well , I should hope so . Tomorrow's picture day .
Well , that speaks volumes , doesn't it ? All right , I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants .
I don't guess . As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation , although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot .
Where ?
Well , Leonard , I think it's high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room .
I don't know the first thing about women , but I would not follow her .
Hello .
Who is it ?
What are they doing here ?
You didn't even let me finish .
ldon : Are you asking me or telling me ?
You want me to remove him from the team ? I'm the captain , I can do that .
She's so tiny . It's funny when she's mad .
Violation of the roommate agreement , overnight guest notification clause .
That's for the fire marshal to determine .
Then don't .
Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart .
Agreed .
My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant invisible cow . They're up to beat an apology out of you .
So what'd you think ?
Hang on .
Of course there is . The Mini Cooper , ' cause it's me .
Hello . I'm Dr . Sheldon Cooper .
Good morning , Amy .
Oh , Penny , excellent . I have a question about these maxi pads . Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype ?
Well , I'm responding to it .
That my genius '
You just got off the list . Would you like back on it ? This'll just take a moment . It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy .
Amy , the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way .
I've seen that . Yeah . Serial Apeist . Howard found it online the day we met you .
The skills are transferrable . I just have no interest in going in the water .
Excellent , excellent . Tire each other out , the ring will be mine . Howard , why don't you go after Raj's mother ?
I'll have the chicken noodle . Goodnight .
One moment . Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic . Apparently , ignorance is bliss . All right , let us begin . Where's your notebook ?
Extra breading ?
Of course .
I came to tell you I've got the answer .
No , once again , I'm throwing you a bone . And once again , you are welcome .
One moment . I'm conducting an experiment .
Sure , why not ? And after the sun's down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek . ' Cause today's the day to stop making sense .
I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures .
What's your point ?
You're embarrassing yourself .
Oh , very much so .
Really ? I didn't know that .
Really ? This time of year ? It's a bit nippy .
You got emotional when that lab monkey died .
I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom .
I told him we'll meet him face-to-face anytime , anywhere .
ldon : I can't give you eight . I can give you seven thirty .
Can you ?
Well , I suppose turnabout is fair play .
Why are you up ?
For future reference , if I want to watch Mean Girls , I'll stream it on Netflix .
Hello .
Renaissance fair ? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair .
Yeah , well , I'm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins .
And I want you to know that I mean it , you know ? This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas .
It's not about shoes , is it ? I don't think I could go through that again .
Oh , good , maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under .
Oh , I'm sorry . Well , if it helps you feel any better you're doing very well so far . Next question , are you fertile ?
ldon : You don't see your mistake , do you ?
She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play . Don't worry . Luckily , I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river .
Oh , it's no trouble , it's actually a pleasure .
Oh , well , thank you . Welcome aboard .
All right , you have to get out of the car right now . I'm not going to jail for you .

And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette .
I am going to record this for posterity .
Well , my mom used to give me sponge baths .
It's a quark-gluon plasma .
Look at us , Leonard , engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol ladies .
Yeah , we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress .
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines . No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that .
Of course I'm sure . Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics , the sign's been changed .
Penny .
Oh ! It's not even Easter time . This is crazy .
Really ?
Before I answer , was he a smoker ? I think you're looking at this all wrong .
Yep , you're mad .
Well , I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind .
Anyway , um , I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you , only one of which is true , and then we don't tell you which one it is , you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence .
So they're both trying to make each other happy , and the end result is they make each other sad ? That's hilarious . I can't wait to tell them .
Just do it .
Perform the experiment immediately .
Correction . Missy can date whoever she wants .
For science , maybe you should .
It is , right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget . , and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , heroes in a half-shell .
Listen to her , Jim .
When I was a little boy and got sick , which was most of the time , my mother would read it to me . It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey , who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different . For some reason I related to it quite strongly .
You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger , my Lord it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again .
Yes , but you didn't portray her as completely irrational .
I'm on the horns of a dilemma . Can you imagine me , Sheldon Cooper , at the North Pole ?
Underworld guardian . We skirmish to the death .
Oh , sure .
You ready to begin ?
Unhand me . This is ridiculous .
Goody . What's it say ?
You're so close .
Morning .
I can't tell you .
Not now , Penny , this poor man needs me .
Well , I never told you about my brother's kidney stone . You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals ?
Good morning and welcome to Science and Society . I'm Dr . Sheldon Cooper , BS , MS , MA , PhD , and ScD . OMG , right ? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd . All right then , we'll begin with opening remarks . Miss Rostenkowski , would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science's responsibility to society ?
Nothing . You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists .
Yeah , it really takes the pressure off .
Lock and load .
No , it's not fine . What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi ? I'm going to call their corporate office . Son of a biscuit .
Yes , but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos .
Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me ?
Okay , well , now that we have the terminology straightened out . How dare you .
That kind of stinks ? Why aren't you more upset ? Did I soften the blow too much ? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting .
No , it's not good enough . It has to be perfect .
Thank you , Leonard .
How many women have you had dates with ?
Leonard , I was just mentioning an interesting local news item . Now , thanks to you , I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat .
Hang on Penny . How about fans , here and here ?
I think I have the same one .
My father loved football . He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework .
Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table ?
Yes , for the first five or six years , but I've gotten used to it . It helps me sleep . He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine .
It's called Scientists . Now , I will name three scientists , then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields . To make this game even more compelling , you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field , not the validity of the field itself . For example , Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology . Okay , ready to have some fun ?
How do I know you're not saying that as part of the manipulation ?
I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here . Dr . Hofstadter , he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen . You know , and Howard Wolowitz , he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot . Oh , and at the office Christmas party , I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar .
Topic one . Faster-than-light particles at CERN , paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese ? And converse .
Ooh . Bad move .
Really ? It's soaking wet .
April 13 , a dark night , indeed .
Exactly half .
No , it's not going to be fine , change is never fine . They say it is , but it's not .
Well that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis . May I suggest it as the topic for your essay .
Seventeen . The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass . By the by , I liked it , too .
Yes .
Thank you .
Thank you . Coconut ? What were you thinking ? Are you a hula girl ?
No , thank you .
I'm begging both of you , please , let's go .
Of course .
I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke , come on , people , it's just a giant thistle , to zzz , the onamona-poetry of sleep .
Oh , yeah ? Well you're a mean person .
For a man so good at predicting my moves , how come you stink at 3 - D chess ?
You , how can you say that ? You show me one thing in here we can live without .
What is it now , tiny Spock ?
Well , now , that .
Wait , if Howard's mother is coming , then you should also steal marbles . Because she's obese , and hippos are obese , and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos , they eat marbles . Maybe I need to dumb these down for you .
Really more to organise , you're not actually dirty , per se .
Look , I didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly .
Okay , here we go . Episode I : The Phantom Menace .
Was that sarcasm ?
Pchew ! Pchew ! Pchew ! Pchew !
Help me move my desk .
Because we don't throw parties .
Ugh , all right , I'll go . But from what I've seen , his attention span is as limited as his bladder control .
This is my girlfriend , Amy . Amy , this is television legend Arthur Jeffries . His science show inspired millions of children .
Priya ?
Oh , all right .
It took you four years to get through High School ?
Hello .
Excuse me .
Excuse me . We're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet .
So , you can experiment on all the apes you want . But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings , suddenly I'm the monster .
Old comic books . I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager .
No , I can't authorize that .
Uh , excuse me , but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it . Do our traditions mean nothing to you ?
You see where I'm going with this .
Leonard .
I'm the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com , dot net , and dot org . What does that tell you ?
Nope .
What is that ?
You're wrong again . If my superpower were arrogance , my name would be Dr . Arroganto .
Well done , Dr . Koothrappali .
What is that awful smell ?
One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation , but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new . He went to work in his friend's biology lab . Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist , part of the Manhattan Project .
It's an experiment .
If it's any consolation , I'm not happy about it either . Good night .
Can you guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night ?
I want you to know that that is sincere . I do feel bad . I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip .
Yes .
Hello . Uh , is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas ? Oh , smashing . Yeah , you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself . Now , down to business . Um , your show ended on a cliffhanger . Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it ? Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . I see . Well , that all stinks . No wonder you got cancelled . Bye .
Counterproposal . I will gently stroke your head and repeat , aw , who's a good Amy .
What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die .
Nevertheless , I've hurt you , and whether you forgive me or not , I want you to have this .
Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile , not an alligator . If you're going to mock me , at least get your facts straight .
We could put her stereo back there .
I bet he's someone from Babylon 5 , we're never going to guess .
Yes . From Szechuan Palace .
My pants are missing , I don't remember anything . Penny , this is your youth . What do I do ?
Huh , that's exactly what Leonard , Wolowitz , Koothrappali , Bernadette and Penny said .
It's not an accident . I waited outside your door for twenty minutes .
That's interesting . Leonard can't process corn .
I'm not sure how to respond , Leonard . I don't own Amy . Can't own a person . At least not since ? 1863 . President Lincoln freed the ? Slaves ! Come on Leonard , if you're going to teach history , these are the kind of facts you'll have to know .
Now , if MA equals MG what does that imply ?
All right , let me show you some of the features of the room . First , windows . Conventional . Open , closed , open , closed , halfway open , or halfway closed , depending on your philosophical bent . Over here is my comic book collection . Feel free to browse . There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand .
But that's my room .
Oh , I don't think I could do that .
Uh , can't complain . Thanks for asking . Well , what were you doing out at three o'clock in the morning ?
No . Glenn's was leather . He was a simple ostrich . Is ! Is , I haven't given up hope .
Thank you , that's very gracious . ' ' ' Gentlemen .
Whether or not he was trying to kill me . For the record , I maintain he was . Where are you going ?
Last week , you told Leonard he couldn't wear his Wookie jacket out in public .
Yes , but not of the same species .
Of course you're fine . Not every member of a species finds a mate . Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin , look at the contributions he made .
Thank you for walking me home .
What ? But he's a mediocre academic . And according to Beverley , his sexual prowess is sub-par . He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate .
Anyway , should you have any interaction with her , it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival .
Uh , you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track ?
Would you like me to bring you some warm milk ?
It's not cool . It's a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons . How'd you do it ?
But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research .
Wrong . Leonard ?
Come on , come on , we're late .
Much better than I expected . She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language . Watch . Welcome to my world . Not welcome to my world . Welcome . Not welcome .
Oh , ow , blueberry in my nose , blueberry in my nose !
I thought where you come from they don't have emotions .
No .
How does that work ?
You have a back-up hypothesis .
The online description was completely misleading , they said eight slots plus removable ID , to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards , but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot , it's a nightmare .
You're parched and weary from battle . You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest , most delicious ale in all the realm .
You have any frozen yogurt ?
Okay , everybody calm down . There is a simple solution here . Raj , take me to the train store , and then I don't care what you people do .
Oh , what did he say ?
Can I look yet ?
You're a carrier . All these people here are doomed . You're doomed !
Wait a minute , I'd want to see that too .
I didn't punch him . He turned around , and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop . I'm not even sure he knows I did it .
Well , I'm not making any promises . Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk , he deceived me .
What was I gonna do ? Two ins in a row ? Where's my lemonade ?
To that point , it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link , which is clearly Leonard as Superman .
MUON !
That's okay . Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about .
You're back .
Well , if x equals the amount that you'll miss me , then I'll miss you x plus one .
Isn't this nice ?
They were not friends , they were imaginary colleagues .
At my age , do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die ?
Wait . Is this really worth it ? We've lived together for years with nary an argument .
So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists ?
I am fine . Here , eat your toast .
You and Leonard don't have anything in common . Maybe you should break up .
Hello .
Hello .
Wait , hold on , hold on . How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away ?
It was . Bernadette had her baby , I made it to Wizarding World , and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration . Hankius pankius .
I'm a grown man .
I wasn't referring to this evening . Ten years ago , upon first seeing me , your husband claimed that I looked like C - 3PO and Pee-wee Herman . And he called me C - 3P - wee Herman .
What do you want , mom ?
Okay , maybe this will help . Imagine you're holding a pen . Before you go too far , not a special pen with your initials engraved on it , that'll make the next part really hard .
Me ?
Hello , Bert . What is your flag-related comment or query ?
But I made it better .
On a cold winter's night ?
No , that's not it .
William Shatner .
Who are you ?
One on one ? We don't play one on one , we play teams , not one on one . One on one !
Shoe sales , hair styles , mud masks , gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina .
Why aren't you talking to me ?
I'll , I'll let you get back to sleep now . Good night .
Yeah , and if he does ask you , go . It's amazing .
So ?
Two trains ?
Oh . I am .
That's what my train used to do .
Oh , I don't know about you guys , but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight .
Now you're asking me to keep a secret from my best friend , colleague , and roommate ?
ldon : But you didn't notify me by e-mail , so this is still a breach .
Oh , I got that covered . Headset . I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying .
That could work .
Well , I must say , Leonard , when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga , I was sceptical .
Gentlemen .
Oh , if that were only true . Unfortunately , as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future , I need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena . Like Enid , Oklahoma . Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity , but no model train shops . Sorry , Enid .
That is apt and amusing . I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler . She'll appreciate the witticism .
I did this for free , let me get a little something .
But we haven't finished the puzzle .
Those are Howard's .
Oh no , Morlocks ? Eat him , eat him . Aaaaargh .
I assumed as much . But never fear . Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel , I have returned to save the day . Odd , usually , he's met by cheers . Anyway , I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations , and it occurred to me that I could benefit '
There are post-prom mating rituals ?
No offence , but this is pure 100 % Nimoy . Because of your mother , you're only 50 % . Which isn't bad , but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away .
You mean my ring ?
I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here , Leonard .
Curse you .
Oh , alright . Leonard .
She's gonna hate the panels .
So , my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants . Very well . They must be destroyed .
Well , you can't be sure of that . What if the helium dealer rats us out ? What if Kripke asks where we got it ? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey ?
I'm sorry . I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark .
Yeah , okay , you can stop trying to make this about our relationship .
Laminate the core material .
No , no . We designed an experiment involving you . See ? Now , isn't that interesting ?
Dear Lord , you're an astronomer . Although you may have earthly woes , get your mind back on the stars . Gee , even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way .
Hmm . No , not yet .
This is moving faster than we thought .
Oh , we got a sword and a plant , our apartment's really shaping up .
I should hope so . When she called me an insensitive jerk , I'd like to think she meant it .
Okay , assuming we could dance , which we can't , there are three of us and two of them .
Oh we'll see about that
How am I supposed to know that ? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter .
Yes , but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring .
All right .
I won ?
Then no , thank you .
What did he say ?
Raj's television . I just realized we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner .
Disagree .
Leonard .
Because of the two additional Ethernet ports .
I don't blame you . You were intoxicated .
No , just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional . And since it is 2003 , I don't know who you are , so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone .
Leonard , I'm dying .
Why would I be jealous ?
One o'clock ? I'm not a raccoon .
Why would I ? That's where all the cool trains are .
Okay , my turn . Let me talk to him .
What happened to the rest of your group ?
Oh , good . Bye-bye .
Let's take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here .
Really ? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs . Vartabedian .
I hate your apartment .
A naked man sat on it . Now , here's my concern , his diet is rich in fatty deli meats . What test do you have to detect lipid residue ?
In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm , and yet not so close as to cause perspiration . In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there , and there . It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct , thus discouraging conversation , nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion , I could go on , but I think I've made my point .
Level three and she thinks she's rich ! What a noob .
Better . It has a gold crown . You see , the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution . Because the crown was irregularly shaped , there was no way to mathematically determine its volume . But , while bathing , Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose .
You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room ?
Oh yes , like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters .
Penny , you appear to have a package here .
If I see one scorpion , I am getting on someone's shoulders and never coming down .
I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being .
I'm glad you think so . That's what I strive to emulate .
I will not calm down . This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered . As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said , the line must be drawn here ! This far , no farther !
Well then you'll want some manganese .
Yes , and evenly distributed amongst brown , white , free range , large , extra-large and jumbo .
Screwed .
Who was he ?
You know , I don't just say smart things about science . I also yodel .
I have the same problem with him . My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive .
Leonard , wait .
All right . It was hell .
Actually , I came to speak to Mrs . Davis .
Oh , my . What an honour . Oh , this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods .
What is it now , Mrs . Wolowitz ?
Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna , or Wien ?
And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out , leaving him humiliated in front of his guests . Love it .
You mean like Spock ?
All the time .
No , what's sad is that you don't know Adam West was TV's Batman .
Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking . Play . Play . Ugh ! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something .
And of those few months , how long have you been a demented sex pervert ?
She told you ?
Yes , ma'am .
I heard a noise .
Heated to precisely 183 degrees ?
Okay . Well , shall we check each other for ticks ?
Not necessarily . I have four months to find some new friends .
Oh , smashing . Now , Leonard , do you know how to get there ?
That's the sauce my mother uses . She likes cooking Italian because according to her , that's what the Romans made Jesus eat .
Yes , but you're much closer to it than he is .
Aquaman , protecting your home since 2012 .
Oh , fine . Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz .
Adversity is to be expected . Continue .
Can I get this comic book , too ?
Dr . Leonard Hofstadter , you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement . Do you waive reading of the charges ?
Oh , no , I wouldn't care for that . Amy ?
Too bad your show is done . I kind of liked it . Leonard , did you hear that ? Oh , the people are heartbroken . I can't take this away from the world . Fun with Flags is back .
Yeah , me , too . I was stuck for a metaphor .
There are takeout containers in the trash can .
Shouldn't you check your database ?
I think you're high on paint fumes . And boy , that's a lot of Band-Aids .
Yeah , she's right . You're grown men , the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches .
Biologically speaking , Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line .
I'm curious about the whole social construct . On its face , the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite , assuming one is afflicted with such , without emotional entanglement , that seems eminently practical . What I've observed , however , is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl .
You forgot your flash drive , You forgot your flash drive
It's like there's a train in your mouth . Howard : Oh , yeah . I've got one . Um , the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago . Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch , bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch . Ooo-ooo .
I'm sorry . Yes , of course .
Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language .
In my defence , I prefaced that by saying ' with all due respect . '
Go ahead .
And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I'm doing so .
As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained , I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement .
You could have told her the truth .
No , no , no , no !
I'm going to propose a hypothesis . Last night , Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret .
Wrong , Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do .
Oh , good grief . This isn't about you . Coming ! Now listen , one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century . So pay attention . Years from now , my biographer might ask you about this event .
All right . These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow . I need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand . Howard , look this over and tell me what's unclear to you .
He's engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum . It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result , and I do not appreciate it .
Oh , jiminy , that's cold .
I'll walk you through it . The game is not called Words with Strangers . No , it's not even called Words with Acquaintances . It is called Words with '
Well , I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before .
I do , but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all ?
I wish I never tried that device . And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair , but this time I mean it .
And snoring . And that's probably just a sinus infection , but it could be sleep apnoea , you might want to see an otolaryngologist . It's a throat doctor .
Leonard , wait . Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her ?
Well , no .
Hello . I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened .
I'm fine with it .
Playing the theremin .
Oh , my goodness , she's coming to visit !
Ah , what might have been . And you , give my regards to Barnum and Bailey .
Leonard , the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience . We have to do our part , too .
We had dinner last night . She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it . Well , little hot dog . I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog . A real , big dog . A hell hound . Tangential to the primary story . How about I circle back to it ?
You can't . I'm the lead author .
Little ball of fur . Keep rubbing .
Welcome back . Our guest today is a returning fan favourite . He puts the reading in your rainbow , the Geordi in your La Forge , and the Kunta in your Kinte , Mr . LeVar Burton .
I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving .
Thank you .
Oh , don't thank me . Thank wireless technology . I realized , I can go to your aunt's awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends .
I suppose that's a fair request . There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience .
If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide .
It's midnight . Happy birthday .
Which way are you going ?
ldon : They don't get a vote . It's one against one . And according to the roommate agreement , all ties will be settled by me .
Bad . However '
I'm still upset about that peanut sauce .
Well , no-one's going to run a DNA test on it , Leonard , honestly you over-think everything .
So as they say , all good things must come to an end .
And here's where we are . The runts in a large litter , unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones .
Of course I could .
Sarcasm ?
Leonard , the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be . You know , like , uh , a semi truck might be an alien robot , or , uh , someone in a romantic relationship , uh , might feel differently than they appear to . Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room . I'm going to pause to let that sink in .
Eating a whole Altoid ?
What a nice girl .
Yes ?
Oh , shut up .
Well , you didn't suggest a beach house .
They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on . But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder , you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man .
What ? No . You mean this was all a ruse ? Oh , how could I be so stu
You say it's itchy and uncomfortable . I say situations like this make me feel the same way .
Look at the two of us . Me , a highly regarded physicist . The kind of mind that comes along once , maybe twice in a generation . You , the common man , tired from your labours as a stockbroker , or vacuum cleaner salesman , or bootblack . But deep down inside , apparently we're just two peas in a pod . A regular pea , and the kind of pea that comes along once , maybe twice in a generation . Rain . Another great equalizer . Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike .
I'm not sorry . That's true .
Oh , you're hardly out of the woods , no . You still run the risk of infection , a blood clot , the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose . The minute you sneeze web , I'm moving out .
Oh . Well , now I'm sorry I asked .
I am . You know , and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends , I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation .
Formal protest .
Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed . Mahalo for nothing , Hawaii .
Hello .
Oh . By all means . When I was a boy , I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver . And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma . Interesting woman . You know , she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat .
Oh , there you are . Just so you know , I was up all night , but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement .
Now , only if you want to .
You want me to give up string theory for something that's less advanced ? You know , why don't you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear ?
I'm returning this stuff to Howard .
Yeah , but you've got a can-do attitude and that's what's important .
Well , as I predicted , I am sick . My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am , and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate .
If this is about the night the heat went out , there's nothing to be embarrassed about .
May I come in ?
For the last time , I am not having a tickle fight with you .
In what space , sir , in what space ? She's two feet above the ground . Frankly , if he really loved her , he'd let her hit the pavement . It would be a more merciful death .
Why ?
Mmm , mmm , mmm . That's Eye-talian .
Sorry . I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality .
Look , it's the same smile she has in the painting .
Oh , I'm glad you like it . Raj picked it out .
Excellent ! What are you planning to wear ?
Surprisingly , yes .
I don't know what colour lonely is .
That's it . The baby's here . It's a boy .
Hello .
Sing soft kitty .
Well , good for you guys . Look , I have a grease smudge on my hand , and I'm okay with it .
Yeah , well , of course I am . I was also right about her hair . It did everything but quack .
Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy .
Be sure to check the mail .
Well , whatever we want . Hang out , do experiments , make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar .
No . It's not the message .
As you know , lizards , cold-blooded animals , lack the ability to sense temperature . But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold . So , lizard weathermen would say things like , bring a sweater , it's slow outside . I love my mind .
Well , off the top of my head , I'd have to go with Excalibur . It gives you the right to rule England .
Leonard , where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
Can't help a friend out in a time of need , huh ? I see where your therapist was coming from .
Like when ?
Section 74 . C . The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot .
Leonard , when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her , and now look , we're going to be late for the movies .
Alright , I think we're going to need some ground rules , in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine , I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine .
But that's my room .
Actually , our friendship group is at capacity . But if anybody drops out , you're at the top of the list . Unless it's Raj , in which case , we'll probably get a person of colour .
Focus , Leonard , focus ! The heat of battle is upon us , the dogs of war are unleashed .

Leonard ?
Yes , and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator .
Without shoes ?
More Pad Thai , please .

Spock ?
In 1890 , Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature . A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets .
Technically , swashbuckler is a combination of two terms . Swash referring to the sound of the sword . Swash . And then buckler meaning a small shield , which you don't have .
What do you think .
Yes , and Hawkeye's in the Avengers , but no one ever says help , Hawkeye .
If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT , sure .
Right , games . They took Halo 1 , Halo 2 , Halo 3 , Call of Duty 1 , Call of Duty 2 , Call of Duty 3 , Rock Band , Rock Band 2 , Final Fantasy 1 thru 9 , The Legend of Zelda , The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time , The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess , Super Mario Brothers , Super Mario Galaxy , Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms . Pacman .
All right , I'll just toss this out to the room . Um , I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps . Now , I couldn't find a caffeine patch , but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository . You know , the interesting fact about the rectum '
Slick , huh ?
Hello .
Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha . ( I did that when I was eight )
Right . Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it , and I shall move the world .
If that happens , don't make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can .
I am a bit of a unicorn . Well , you certainly seem like a special lady , uh , but as you know , you missed the deadline , so thanks for playing .
And a funny Greek letter .
Who listens to the radio any more ?
It's time travel , Leonard , I will have already done that .
No , Leonard , go ahead and mock . Like my daddy always said , Shelly , women aren't anything but flippin pains in the bottom .
The , the revisions I made start on page four .
Why would you knock over a lamp ?
I hardly think so . You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes , bees , bears , snakes , possums , poison oak , oh , and last , but not least , teenagers with guitars .
Hang on .
Spicy mustard from the Korean deli ?
Uh , breakfast yes , lunch no . I did have a cough drop , but that really rides the line between sucking and eating .
There are a number of options and , I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities , air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice .
My point .
Oh . You got even smaller . I love it . Uh , Meemaw , this is Leonard . Leonard , this is my Meemaw .
Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does ?
Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded , wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder ?

Maybe you're right .
The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future , which society had splintered into two factions , the sub-terranean Morlocks , who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy .
No , thank you .
Yes . And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves .
Well , if it's any consolation , I'm sure Leonard's tormented every moment he's away from your warm embrace and cherry lips .
Yeah , I always thought if I were ever enslaved , it would be by an advanced species from another planet , not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale .
I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars . Which places me in your debt and I can't be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move , or to kill a man .
Nothing . I said nothing .
Yeah , I think we should talk about that .
Mm , indeed .
Great .
Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce ?
I know our apartment's small , but I think we can make room .
Yeah , herbal tea for me , please .
But I haven't decided yet .
Leonard .
I sense you're making a joke , but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin , so do not forward my mail there .
If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning , I think I can face a simple award ceremony .
Then it must be a tumour .

She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment . I have no choice but to assume the worst , given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions .
Peas ! Perfect , they can be electrons .
Well , wealthy means a lot of money , and vastly means even more . I'm not sure what's tripping you up .
Baffling , right ? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers . I stopped so I could ask the question . Next thing I know , good-bye , kissy face . Hello , yelly face .
What about this one ?
Let's celebrate .
Uh , fine . FYI , secret-keeping ? Hate it . Hand-holding ? Not a fan . Hammerhead shark ? I love that thing . Yeah , it's another fish with a tool on its head .
No more than Penny .
No , we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet .
Yes , and do you know what the odds are I'd pick your name ?
Of course . She's spent many nights here , and you're worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding .
Yeah , that , too . And scoot over . Part of your shadow's on my spot .
But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go .
You're blowing it . We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him .
Just , please , bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal .
I'm sorry , no .
Sadly , it's not . Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle , but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab .
Howard , which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train ?
So you're saying this is a regulation deck ?
On the one hand , the Xbox One has a better camera , but the PS4 has a removable hard drive . Thoughts ?
Fine , if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip .
Um , as you know , several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot , when I called you an idiot . And I just wanted to say that I was wrong . To point it out .
They are in 2003 .
Indeed . Penny , a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day .
Keys ! Keys ! Keys !
Nope . The only thing left to do now is assign blame . (
I got my job back .
Leonard , Penny , I just , I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you . That's a lie .
I get to write a contract ? I say , let's get this party of the first part started .
You know , uh , once I ordered an Uber by accident . I just got in and went somewhere .
I'm trying not to attract attention .
What ? He said he was fine .
No .
Darn . If you weren't busy , I'd ask you to join us .
You tracked my phone ?
Thank you .
I think you'll like the drill tonight . I've tried to make it fun . Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event . Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada . Pick a catastrophe , any catastrophe .
In Leonard ? Oh , even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely .
Penny , I assure you , I'm fine . My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual . There were no emotional bonds , the severing of which would cause me any discomfort . The relationship simply outlived its utility , and I'm continuing on with my life as before .
I'm sorry , Raj , but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge .
I can't .
Yes .
No . This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole .
Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is ?
If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty .
Think carefully here . Clause 209 suspends our friendship , and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials . Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent , utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall .
I'm listening , amuse me .
How do you know I'm not using the facilities ?
Well , then , you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots .
Uh , for the hundredth time , I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart .
You see , the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate , but I have devised a foolproof plan . See , I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself , feigning digestive distress .
Oh , how I wish I could .
Yeah , but you've got all those things , and no one's lining up to be you .
If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable , lists would be on the top of that list . Okay , now , oh , since last we spoke , have you acquired any pets ?
No , it's not . I've got five more slides .
Oh , that's ridiculous . A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory .
What's the protocol for leaving ?
The majority of people have dark hair . Even you , at one time .
Oh , just let me look . Oh , my goodness . I see quivering black lines . Those must be neurons , oh , they're so thick and beautiful .
I suggest you go through with it .

How do I do that ?
Very well .
Bartenders are supposed to have people skills .
But , since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless , I just have to find something else to focus on .
But why ? Other than you two fighting , we're having such a good time .
Are you currently pregnant ?
Does it ? A happy accident .
Now ! Do it !
Excuse me . You're misusing the word ho . It's an interjection used to call attention to a destination , not an object , as in , uh , Land , ho ! Or , uh , Westward , ho !
Well , you call it love , but it has a lot of raisins in it .
Now I know how the African slaves felt . Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man .
Cholermus . It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish . I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland .
My problem is I'm out of tea .
Well , now don't you feel silly .
Big boy !
You used to make those jokes about me . Now everything is Bert , Bert , Bert .
Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon '
Then , this is my first date .
Please , no , nothing so pedestrian . I wanted a griffin .
There's that prostate doctor , but I'm still mad at her . Oh , there's a woman . I'll make her my girlfriend .
We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen . And if that doesn't work , I'm going to poison his tea .
That is true . She keeps asking how long Amy's going to be gone .
Well , I believe I'm treating you generously . That's why I've stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own .
But , that's Star Wars Day .
Only you .
Moot . Rendered unimportant by recent events .
Again , not enough evidence . For all we know , he's being murdered . Now , back to our game .
Well , actually , the risk of throat cutting is very low . On the other hand , severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger .
What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand ?
Yeah . Raj made the funniest joke , he said , which is the best ladder to use to hang myself ?
Yes , if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page , an online blog depicting his descent into drug use , and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com .
Oh , well , then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me . Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me . All right , this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt .
Not if you're a rugby team .
If I could , I would , but I can't , so I shan't . Now , knowing Penny , the obvious answer is , they engaged in coitus . But , since that's what it looked like , we can rule that out . Let's put on our thinking cap , shall we ?
You know , speaking of attorneys , if I ever needed a lawyer , I would not hire She-Hulk .
It's a kindness , Leonard . Otherwise , you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips .
Golly , she sounds too good to be true .
You claim it's going to be a week , but I have no faith in your dry cleaner .
Oh ! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair ? He'll sit down , it'll sound like he's flatulent , even though he's not .
You also made a common grammatical mistake , you said nauseous when you meant nauseated . But go on .
Well '
Oh , really ? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end , why didn't you try to help me ?
Just roll the clip .
Yes .
Wow . A Death Star cake .
What are you doing ?
Howard , I have a few questions . I found three bowling pins . Now , do you juggle these , or are you missing seven ?
May I point out to you all that the screening is first come , first served ?
Oh , I'm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch , it will be embarrassing .
All right .
On your way home , will you pick up some orange juice ?
Hm !
Well , I say that's the last time we ever go outside .
Wow . I anticipated we'd have problems , but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them .

Oh , fine , I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence .
You know , I wonder how she feels about all this artwork .
What are you trying to pull , Mom ? From the top .
Too bad . I'm coming with you .
What's sheetrock ?
Yeah , I know . Forever . Who would have believed these things would happen to us ?
To be honest , I did .
Yeah , well , tell it to someone who cares .
I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie , he's kind of a bummer .
I would imagine it is . This is my friend and roommate , Dr . Leonard Hofstadter .
Go north . You can't go that way . Go west . A troll blocks your passage . Okay , fasten your seatbelts , kill troll . With what ? With sword .
Oh . How much does it cost to get them off my lap ?
By this much .
Blonde women , huh ?
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer .
Wrong . The best number is 73 . You're probably wondering why .
Hold on . We don't know anything about this woman .
Bert , Rebecca . I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier .
Fine , let's go . Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch .
Wonderful . I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move . If I knew what that meant , I might just do it .
Oh .
By that reasoning we should also play bridge , hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition .
Unlikely . That's a television show , Leonard .
I understand . Oh , Shelly ? A man's here to take you away to the future ! Be sure to pack clean underwear . '
I suppose that's one way to look at it .
I don't think so , Kripke . I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day .
So have these two , and they're having dinner with us .
Personally , I find the notion of external rewards demeaning . I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery .
Come in .
All right , if you must watch , then mute it with closed captions , please .
I believe I've made some progress on our ground rules .
I guess we'll call this a draw .
Oh , it's nice to meet you . I admire your father's work very much . It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey began in my hero's scrotum .
Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess , perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed .
I would like to change mine . The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine . Now it's completely different from Goonies .
Well , you're my friends . You'll be standing by my side , supporting me , feeding me legal precedents , and if you had the upper body strength , carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious .
You know , I have to say , Penny , I don't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this .
We're going to be late . I'm pacing nervously .
Fascinating .
I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster . Boy , you're good .
I know , I know , good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown , geez .
The way you put away those lemon bars , perhaps that's a good thing .
Well , if you're going to serve Cornish game hen , you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it .
To drinking .
Uh , elephant ?
Thank you , but I'll be fine .
Thank you . Hello , neighbour .
Well , hello .
Stop yelling ! I'm not happy about this .
Excuse me , Stuart . Have you read the new Flash ?
And to clarify ?
Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport ?
Cookies ?
Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition , yes she is .
Hello .
Score one for liquor and poor judgement .
Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us . You give us the helium first .
Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor .
I'm fine . Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder .
Oh , wait . Did you want to talk about what's bothering you ?
Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny ?
Which means his triumph will be even larger . Minstrels will write songs about him .
You put no thought into that .
Old comic book . I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box .
Well , rest assured , I am in full possession of my faculties .
What do you do ?
Barely knew him .
Yes .
No , you really shouldn't have . I brought my own .
Howard , you know me to be a very smart man . Don't you think if I were wrong , I'd know it ?
Mind you , when we say behind the flags , we don't literally mean these flags . That's just where we have dinner .
Why ?
A housewarming gift for Raj .
Uh , wait , before we eat , I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj .
You whistled ?
What , are you crazy ? I'm on a unicycle .
This is an interesting way to stay out of it .
I just threw up the bachelor party .
Yes , Penny .
Yeah , I hate wedding receptions . I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins , slip on the ring , disappear and everyone goes home .
As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India , you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature .
Okay , let's do this .
I know , and I do yearn for faster downloads , but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm , what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve .
I knew you'd understand , Armadillo Isaac Newton .
I don't know . A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold ?
That was fun . Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores .
So when will you reopen ?
The same way any normal person would . I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti .
I help the weak . It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman .
I may have failed .
Um , to go to Jewish heaven ?
I like it . I think you're on to something .
Oh , no , not just a season . If I'm in , I'm in for the whole run , even if the quality declines .
Leonard , be glad you can't keep a woman . They are a handful .
GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours .
Playing it . I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme . And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet , gathering dust .
Good to know . Yeah , a few more helpful hints like that , you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies . ( Answering phone ) Hello . I see . Uh , what time ? Very well , then . Huh . That was the Human Resources Department at the university . Apparently , my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace .
Oh , please . Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics .
No point . It's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle . What makes you chuckle , Leonard ?
With real puffing smoke ?
So am I . His passing makes me feel bad .
Um Well You are black , right ?
Are you insane ? If she leaves , it's over !
I'm not a child . I know the word ninny .
Stuart , please . You're being rude .
Aw , nuts ! One '
I did not get a clear answer . I'm gonna set this down now .
No . Not only that , it has shifted from clear to milky green .
We're not afraid of physical activity .
I see you're drinking wine .
I'm going to go inside , put on my coziest pajamas , curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over .
I told you . Buying scalped tickets is against the rules . If you get caught , you get banned from Comic-Con for life . Life , Leonard . You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old , and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days .
No , but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack .
That is a snowy tree cricket . Oecanthus fultoni . I was done with Latin by fifth grade .
No , no , that's crazy . You go ahead and talk while I figure it out .
I may have a better way that you can teach me .
Of course she does . Making me food is her way of saying I love you . Making me food when she's too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you .
She's also a bit of a know-it-all . Mmm . This is good . Whatever it is .
Oh , there it is , tacos .
Okay . Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother ?
I've been thinking about what happened , and I hope this gift will make things better .
No , see ? Well , you absolutely would not . And furthermore , the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included .
Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays .
You know I don't drive .
You know , the holidays are just around the corner . Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there .
Oh , good one .
You know I'm right .
No .
Howard , I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson . I obviously didn't make my point with those people .
Oh , Shelly ? A man's here to take you away to the future . Be sure to pack clean underwear .
Given your community college education , I encourage you to ask me as many as possible .
Yes , of course that's why it's tight .
You first .
I've never seen this show before and now I'm starting with episode 246 ? It's unnatural .
Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet .
This is not the time for joking . We're doing serious research , which requires complete and utter focus .
Can I make you a cup of tea ?
Well , then at least hold her still so I can pretend she's stuffed . Raj , I let my emotions get the best of me , and I unfairly took it out on you .
No , although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool .
Oh , I have a solution , first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device .
Why not ?
So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start . How , Howard , flashback sounds .
She can't shoot me . She's dead .
Well , I never thought of it like that . Boy , frame of reference will just sneak up on you , won't it ?
Oh , I'm so sorry for your loss . On a cheerier note , I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon . What do you say you take me over there , buddy boy ?
Name one time I've ever done that .
Bakersfield . I see . Where has this list been all my life ?
Hi .
They have beach right in the name . What do you think ?
Fire demon .
Nothing .
I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one's been touched . By the way , if you hope to have children , I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers . Your testicles look a tad warm .
I was , but Penny didn't want to . You didn't want to . Bernadette , Amy , Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to . And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody .
A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack .
Hold on , I have one condition .
You laugh now , you just wait until you need tech support .
Well , you should be . Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you . And not just on the cheek , but on the mouth . Like mommies and daddies do .
Yes , I'm aware of the math , Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth , the issue remains , how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection ?
Why would you do that ?
Have you ever considered trying to do something useful ? Perhaps , reading to the elderly ?
I don't see anything in here a woman would want .
Every year . I told you , wear a diaper .

I changed my mind . Get out of my spot .
How could you not find him ?
Well , I suppose it's appropriate .
ldon : We don't watch Babylon 5 in this apartment .
Not pistols . Minds . A trivia contest , and you may choose the field of battle . Star Trek trivia , Star Trek : Next Generation trivia , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine trivia , Star Trek : Voyager trivia , or model trains .
Very well .
Why are you such a stupid head ? That is also rhetorical . I'm sorry you had to hear that .
Well , what should I do ?
Coming !
Close ! Neeeeeoooooowwwww !
My point .
It was in my weekly e-mail blast . Right between beet season is finally here , and uh-oh , red stool from beets leads to cancer scare .
Hmm , yes , you did . Now , to review the following provisions are hereby activated . In the refrigerator , as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf , the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal . Next , apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells . Third , the bathroom schedule . Now , I'm given to understand women have different needs , so , we'll have to discuss that .
Oh , but I want to be Hawking's friend .
Oh . This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility . Raj , you're back in . He likes monkeys .
Impressive as that may be , Monte is not us . Monte has no fear .
Leonard , have you gotten married yet ?
You do ?
Yes . Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody ?
All right , that's it . Strike three .
But I apologized . And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong .
Oh , Leonard . Lots of people love you and want to help you , but they can't until you admit the problem .
Good , good , if you had said something clever , she might've gotten suspicious .
You're right . That is more menial . Hello , I'm Sheldon . I'll be your server today . I don't recommend the salmon . I saw it in the kitchen .
I'm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping .
Of course . I just explained it to you . Now , where do you stand on it ?
Yes . You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me . So I'd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series , Little House on the Prairie .
When are you going to talk to him ?
Yes . No , yeah , but in his defense , that wasn't racist . He's also brown .
Hurry up , find him , find him .
I see what you're doing . You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy , he tells everyone we're going to be there , and when we don't show , he looks the fool . Fiendishly clever .
A doctor ? Well , I hope you're not contagious . I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes .
No , you're not . Pay no attention to that man in the bed .
You're in my spot .
I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man .
Well , they're looking for fans to interview , and Wil thought I'd be good for it .
Yeah , and some thanks I got . The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami .
She's right , as long as you're vomiting , coitus is contra-indicated .
I don't know why that surprises you . I'm a grown man . As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel .
Oh please , if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago . Somewhere between tool using and cave painting , homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose .
Yet another child left behind .
It's asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma .
Why not ?
Indeed . I was the world's smartest caterpillar . And then after pupating in our nation's railway system , I've burst forth as the world's smartest butterfly .
In my present , it's in the future . In your present , it's been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot .
I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile . I have endless patience . I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service .
It seems we have a choice to make . Abandon all ground rules in the name of science , or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship .
Physically , yes , but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason .
Well that's a delightful little story , but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything , I answer the questions .
Ooh , sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about . I'd put on my listening ears if I were you .
What an innovative solution . Perhaps I don't give your MIT education enough credit .
Leonard , wait . This is highly unethical .
Well , that was fun . Good for you , Leonard .
Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto ?
Really ?
That's nice . Now in German .
Well , I can't take all the credit . It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way .
My apologies . Good night , Amy .
Uh-huh .
And if I may get serious for a moment , hosting this show has been one crazy ride . But with all its ups and downs , I wouldn't give it up for the world . Except for now , when I'm giving it up . Before I sign off , I'd , uh , I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag . It's good for times like this . Good night .
That's strange . That he would come to you for that and not me . Oh , I got two emails from him . Do you have Leonard's email address ? And . Never mind , I found it . I can't believe he picked you over me .
Maybe this isn't a good time .
No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth .
BRB . That's short for be right back . I'm saving so much time .
Oh , now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand . Yeah , check for your watch , Gustaf . He might have lifted it .
I do . And yet I'm doomed while you live on .
Oh , I am . And you realize what the next step is ?
Leonard moves the meeting not occur . Is there a second ? None heard , the motion fails . I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr . Stephanie .
I tried reaching out to my mother , but she was in Bible study . Leonard's mother is on a book tour . My Mee-Maw was taking a nap , and after a while Siri started repeating her answers .
You see what happens when you let girls play D & D ?
Well , we were on our way to my mother's house '
Because in the last ten minutes , Santa came to town , kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer . I had a drunk uncle who did all those things . Nobody sings songs about him .
Actually , much better .
How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own ?
At the hands of those teenagers .
Well , wait . What if , just this once , we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later ?
Precisely , I didn't do anything . Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math ?
Oh . Good morning , shoemaker . I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night .
Hello .
Do you mind ? We're having a moment here .
I've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals .
Fine .
I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation .
Well , Gollum , you're an expert on rings . What do I do with this one ?
You can't be serious . If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense , I'd follow Leonard on Instagram .
Yes , there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled .
You call tech support .
Now of course , my 9am is your noon , so let's avoid the whole good morning , good afternoon minefield , and let's just say hello .
Okay , I just did . What was it ?

All righty ! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena , reducing mighty edifices to dust , engulfing the city in flames . The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded . Oh , excellent choice . Now , put on your hard hat and safety vest .
No , thank you , but for the record , I'm an excellent dancer . Proficient in the rumba , waltz and cha-cha .
Yes .
Well , yes , of course , he wouldn't like that at all . Last night , I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother .
You seemed confused .
I hate you .
You're welcome . Now let's get this over with .
No , you're a tool I was using to make my point .
I want her to feel at home . I also bought scented soaps , pantyhose , Midol , calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel .
Oh , I like their emergency room . Yeah , even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever , they still let you take a lollipop .
It's too late . I call dibs .
Aren't I ?
I'm not ignoring my sister . I'm ignoring all of you .
Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas ?
I'm not upset . I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it .
Excuse me , the whole tenure system is ridiculous . A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent . If we really want science to advance , people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid .
Tandoori Palace ?
May I say one last thing .
Ooh , my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points . That's right , I call him Stephen now , because I checked , and he was not okay with Wheels .
That's not how it looks in the picture .
Sheldon Cooper does not cry .
No ? But we're friends !
If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate , hello .
Thought I heard you out here .
You're right , you did kind of kill the mood .
They do some of their best work at night .
Has to be ? Has to be ? I hope you're being deliberately provocative .
However , on an unrelated topic , I am never getting out of this bed again .
Come on .
Waterfalls . Crashing waves . Babbling brooks .
Well , the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright .
Leslie Winkle . Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world , why does it have to be Leslie Winkle ?
Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up ?
Here . Now , are we friends ? Colleagues ? Lovers ? Are you my grandmother ?
Did you laugh ?
Careful , it's that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year's Who Con .
Oh , that's not necessary . You can go first .
So it was working .
Do you have the enchanted sword ?
Her name is Dr . Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial .
Hello .
Ooh , Siam Palace ?
Well , that's the thing about factoids , they're interesting .
I have GPS on my phone . I know you turned around .
Oh , hello .
Really , how does it work ?
Oh , other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system , hunky-dory .
Professor Hawking , how nice of you to call .
Forgive me , but I think you'll find my story is more interesting .
Thank you for understanding .
I question your premise . How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people ?
That makes two of us . My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days . Come on , one .
AFK . Away from keyboard .
She's still not answering .
I have mixed feelings about doing interviews . I like the part where I talk . I do not like the part where the other man talks .
Oh , I'm in your hands . Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS .
Excuse me . Do you have any books about making friends ?
Well , why isn't everyone happy ? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again .
Three in the morning is a good time for bongos .
Amy is free . She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled . Boy , when you take an interest in people , you really uncork a geyser of nonsense .

And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo ?
Fine , I guess I'm stuck with Raj .
They're perfect . It tastes like her hugs .
That is the prevailing opinion .
Would you like to be ?
It's not Elvish . It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script . One Ring to
Oh , but I won't be there .
Great , so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists .
I grew up in Texas . Football is ubiquitous in Texas . Pro football , college football , high school football , peewee football , in fact , every form of football except the original , European football , which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot .
Amy , the Daleks are right on my tail , quick , we need to reset the time circuits . Oh , no , I left my sonic screwdriver behind .
I was always afraid this day would come . This might be the first step of my descent into madness , where I gradually test the limits of public nudity .
I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying , angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair .
What's the occasion ?
Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard , I've had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ' 06 .
Another reason to consider a life of piracy . Even today , I understand that's an all-male profession .
No .
The first one's free ? Flash , how do you stay in business ?
Look on the bright side . As the result of Penny's forfeit , you have become the world's first winner of Research Lab . Would you like a commemorative snow cone ?
Yes .
Thank you .
All right , just warn me before you do it .
Because Leo is a middle child .
And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here .
For starters , we enjoy spending time together .
Penny , if you wouldn't mind , I'd like to have a conversation about girls .
Oh . Alright , noted . Sorry .
He does .
Yeah , I thought so , too , but she's acting very strangely . I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus , and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow . Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law's witch doctor practice .
Really ? Where's your friend Justin going to sleep ?
Father .
It depends on the activity . For a prostate exam , yes . If you're playing Vegas , I'd add sequins .
A little bit ? The man Super Glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples .
But , now , but in my defence '
Excuse me , we just went over this . As the quintessential middle child , your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention .
No , I gave it to her well . Now , over here , I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put '
I accept your premise , I reject your conclusion .
If our friend , the flag , has taught me anything , it's to go where the wind takes you . As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole . And , action . So , Penny , what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night ?
I'm not going to apologise , I didn't say anything that wasn't true .
No , it's not fine . It is a breach of line etiquette .
Am I ? The mind's a mysterious thing , Leonard . He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn .
I knew it ! What do I do ?
This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton , by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say .
I don't know . I looked around the room , and I saw all the faces and the presents , and it , it was just too much .
Is the sex starting now ?
ldon : No ! That's where I sit !
And Radio Shack .
Last night was Wednesday . Wednesday is comic book night . Tonight , we'll be going on Thursday , because it's Anything Can Happen Thursday .
I can make it , but I won't .
You know , I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick . When Penny got food poisoning , she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television .
I won't be there .
This diagram . I assume you were opening with a joke . It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps .
It's not the same thing . I don't think you know how I feel at all .
How would I know , do you have a low sperm count ?
Why are you here ?
Technically that would be coitus interruptus .
Thank you .
Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century . If anything they would have said ' huzzah ! '
Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door ?
Oh , no , I should apologize . Uh , I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you .
Better . Did Wil and Adam leave ?
Oh , is it ? Look at this . General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under specialties . It's now under chicken .
If it makes you feel any better , Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night .
I think Dr . Nowitzki is a friendly colleague . I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor . And I need to update my r'sum to include swimming as a special skill .
Uh-oh .
It really doesn't matter , as long as it's challenging .
Where exactly ? Sheldon Square ? Sheldon Towers ? Sheldon Stadium , home of the Fighting Sheldons ?
Hmm . Yeah , you're right . It's like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem . You know , I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides . But now I'm just like , eh .
But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk .
Sorry ? You may not realize it , but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life . You know , understanding sarcasm , feigning interest in others , not talking about trains as much as I want to . It's exhausting . Which is why , for twenty minutes a day , I like to go down to that room , turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge .
Right . Always right .
Why would you do that ? You're a string theorist as well .
See ? Why don't I believe you ?
I haven't settled on anything yet .
Exactly .
Because , according to him , you're oversensitive and have a temper .
Here's the problem with teleportation .
All right .
All right , I'll try .
Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing , and it's now six oh eight , I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out ? and , uh , How are they hanging ?
Well , you sit back , relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory . You see that cabin there ? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land . Yeah . Personally , I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong , but this is your favourite show , not mine . Oh , look at little Laura Ingalls , eating that peanut butter sandwich . Peanut butter ? Huh ? That's strange , since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s . If I knew this show was about time travel , I would have watched it much sooner .
Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium ?
So that's all this day was ? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news ?
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line .
In a few minutes , when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise , how would you prefer I do it ? The standard I told you so ? The classic neener-neener ? Or just my normal look of haughty derision ?
Everybody hold on . Let's take this problem one step at a time . First , we need to decide whether we're calling it leever or lehver . And the sooner we decide it's leever , the sooner we can roll up our sleeves , not slehves , and get to work .
Why would I do that ?
ldon : What is going on here ?
Fine . In the parlance of the urban music scene , what's the 4-1- 1 ?
Of course . First , consider an ordinary magnet which has ,
No , sir , no , I took my dad's desk chair , attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat . Granted most people thought I was R2 - D2 , but still , I got a lot of candy .
That doesn't mean one won't be in another , especially if I'm driving .
It doesn't matter . That's my spot .
Hello , I'm Dr . Sheldon Cooper . Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags . My apologies that this episode is coming late . I did shoot one last week , in honour of Black History Month , but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist . My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community , who , like me , have been kept down by The Man . Now , Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado , it's also for the flag novice , so , to help me with that , please welcome my friend , neighbour , and flag virgin , yeah , not a real virgin . She's had coitus many times . Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast . Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles . Penny .
Brent Spiner , what have you done ? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend , Wil Wheaton .
Penny , you're an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain , walk him through this .
Wait . You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table ?
It's not hard . It's simple . You can either sit with me , your friend , colleague and roommate , or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with .
Enjoy having the place to yourselves .
Thank you . I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard .
No , this is fun . Oh , the thing about tomatoes , and I think you'll really enjoy this , is , they're shelved with the vegetables , but they're technically a fruit .
I can see how that would be upsetting . Come in . I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch .
Brown rice , not white rice ?
Excellent . If the yogurt works , I bought some delightful scented candles .
Why not ?
More ? I mean , look at us . It's only been three years , here we are in bed together .
Shut it . Offices are assigned by seniority . I arrived at the university first .
That's funny , because my father was not a very clever man .
Bleeding from my ears .
So , you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere ?
And that's how you make effort look effortless .
I'm going to buy her a present .
She does have a short attention span .
Congratulations . You may not have succeeded in getting cash , but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt .
Oh , I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory , specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space .
The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family .
They found the remote controlled cars .
You could make it a train room .
Swish .
I just gave you a reasonable explanation .
Yes ! This party just became a major rager .
I know how to behave .
A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition . This is an ordinary top hat . You've chosen that card freely . I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister .
So , how was your day ?
Okay . But I think it could have ended with the karaoke .
That's preposterous . I do not resemble C3PO . Don't get me wrong , I'm flattered , I just don't see it .
That's easy for you to say . Your chair's not facing the lingerie section . Boy , that's a lot of panties .
Yes , I'm getting a free pizza . I'm on a roll .
It doesn't matter , right now you're looking for treasure .
Good idea . Attention is what birds want .

Well , a lot , it's very annoying . Has something changed ? Um , is there something that you're not telling me ?
Meeting , meeting , bo-beeting , banana-fana , fo-feeting , fee-fi mo-meeting .
No . I was just tricking you .
Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium ?
Barry , a word ?
Oh , Leonard , great news . We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together .
There you go .
Well , you're the doctor , but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound .
Oh , it's not your fault . I've been to the model train store . I've been to Radio Shack . This woman is impossible to shop for .
It says here you're a chemist . Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches ?
Well , I thought we were having a nice conversation , but it turns out I was being offensive .
What is there to talk about ? You have to take it . It's important .
All right , why don't we open it up to Q & A from the audience ?
The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject .
It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form .
I'm confused . You're always saying that you want to spend more time with me .
Hello .
Boy , I'm glad we're going out again .
December 25 , 1642 , Julian calendar , Sir Isaac Newton is born . Jesus , on the other hand , was actually born in the summer . His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats . Which , frankly , sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake .
Based on your academic record , any number of things , I would imagine .
But she's got Google Maps on her phone .
Patience , patience , Barry . The whaffle the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly .
And of course , the answer is 130 adoseconds .
That's not the secret knock . This is the secret knock .
Plus , I get to hang out with him again at the hearing . This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy .
That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious . Oh , now I'll never know what happened .
I'm sorry , Raj , but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor . And without rules , the competition has no meaning . And without meaning , the following would be an empty gesture .
You need to go to the back of the line .
What about the cream cheese frosting .
I'm doing it . I'm doing it . I'm tall and I'm doing it .
Hello .
Oh . Okay . You know , I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but , we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought .
Well , of course , but , not by myself .
Oh , no , I got bored with that . I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon .
What do they have ?
I stand corrected . Fun .
I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere , the dream of a cold , rational world entirely without human emotion . Spock came from a planet governed only by logic . You know , on Vulcan , when your brother asks , why are you hitting yourself ? the answer is , I'm not . You're moving my arm . To which he says , Fascinating . And then you both watch educational television .
Howard , are you having a make your own sundae bar ?
Well , he didn't actually say anything , but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia .
Why are you crying ?
That's why the call it cloaking , dead man .
Yeah , right on , man . Right on . Oh , look , it's Harry Potter and 98 % of The Sorcerer's Stone .
Well , I don't think you have a shot there . I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs . Now , given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability .
I've always found that an inappropriate slur . Chickens are not , by nature , at all timid . In fact , when I was young , my neighbour's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house .
You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard ?
It was fine . Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me , I slept the whole way .

A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board . He makes his move . He's dividing both sides by I . He's adding back the coefficient . He has a value for P . He's plugging that back in . He takes the derivative , and he solves the equation . The crowd goes wild . Nobel ! Nobel !
Mmm , all right . It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence . Good night . Please note , it is now past ten p . m . Per our roommate agreement , kindly refrain from raucous laughter , clinking of glasses , and celebratory gunfire .
Think of me when you apply it .
I'm helping you with Stephanie .
Excuse me , but I have some concerns about these questions .
Leonard , she might be drunk . All she had was chips .
Not just a sticker . That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow .
The theory is that if you really tax your brain , the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous .
You sure I can't get you that cup of tea ?
Are you comfortable ?
Yes , it's just that in all the years I've known him , he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration . I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened .
Just look . I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team . The colours are based on Star Trek , the original series . The three of you will wear support red , and I will wear command gold .
Darn tootin ' , I win .
All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one . That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground . Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef .
Remarkable . In just under a half hour , 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard's keister . And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy , has been Tetris and mail-order brides .
Well , isn't this nice . Sometimes the baby wins .
Well , it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting ' How wasted am I ? which is met with an approving chorus of ' Dude . '
Hello .
Oh , for heaven's sake . I did your laundry , I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles , I , I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom .
No , it's not the Never mind .
My original point .
Electrons move through graphene , act as if they have no mass '
Yes . And that's coming from me .
No .
I do tonight . It's scary over there .
This party is just going to suck .
Very well done .
You know this is all your fault .
That is true . I have a higher than normal body density . If I run too deep a bath , I drown .
Hi . Um , I've reconsidered . Uh , you can't work where I work . Enjoy the rest of your evening .
Little generic . Keep thinking . We'll circle back . Wil Wheaton , go .
What I want is irrelevant . This is Penny's decision . Penny ?
That seems a fairly efficient arrangement .
In a perfect world , I'd lock you in a stockade in the public square . That probably requires a permit .
Your turn , Leonard .
Afterwards , Leonard blew his nose , and pie came out .
No , I meant turn right , and you missed it . Maybe you do need to know .
About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck .
Of Texas .
The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses . Moving on .
It's about streetcars ? Oh , great . I won't need this .
Unit cell contains two carbon atoms . Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees .
Uh-duh , hold on , hold on !
All right .
No , no , no , no , don't wake her . She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine .
You heard the man , Leonard . And while you're at it , I'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest , so make me cocoa . Point of inquiry , given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend , why didn't you seek refuge under his roof ?
No , I wasn't talking to Leonard .
You can try , but you'll never catch me .
I can't believe he fired me .
233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on .
I'm in a great mood .
I assure you I am quite real and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter .
Because it was immaculate , I mean , you open that man's closet , it was left to right , evening gowns , cocktail dresses , then his police uniforms .
I hadn't thought about that .
Next .
Well , how can you say that ? Professor Proton's the best .
That's unacceptable . We're supposed to be given written notice .
What does it look like ?
I always tell people , if you have only one day in Los Angeles , make it a train day .
Frankly , Mom , I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become , willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge .
Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy , which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time . Unless they're German , ' cause that's a tough crowd .
He sounds like a sociopath .

All right .
Well , he doesn't say it's a good game .
It is also indigenous to Brazil , as is the Cocoa Bean , from which we get chocolate , the best pudding . And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore !
It was like a grapefruit .
No . Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended .
It doesn't need proving .
You know what ? I don't always recognize sarcasm , but I do right now , and I don't appreciate it . I'm sorry for your loss . But you're not the only one whose day has been a disaster .
What ? That's absurd . Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research .
You're not Mr . D'Onofrio . I get my hair cut by Mr . D'Onofrio . You believe this guy ?
Yes , well , apparently neither does anyone else .
Play through the pain .
Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth . So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA .
Leonard , it's two in the morning .
Okay . Well , then , uh , first things first . Um , are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem ?
Come again ?
That is my desk chair , that is where I work . I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot . I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot .
Nope .
What'd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends ?
Yes .
Well , now do you see the problem ?
I should hope so . That's from the first Spider-Man movie .
Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah , behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee ?
ldon : Why not ?

Ooh , that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl . You know what ? You eat it . You're married , it doesn't matter what you look like .
All right . Hmm , huh , I'm sorry , I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling .
A little messy ? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy , this is chaos . Excuse me , explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid . I'm just inferring that this is a couch , because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale .
I'm trying to shoot .
Oh , bad news . Amy's making me go shopping with her later , so looks like none of us can go .
All right , are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honor Blanc's 1778 use of interchangeable parts ? The assembly line , of course .
I assume we're talking about you now ?
I'm sorry , I got bored and drifted off . Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie ?
A summons for what ?
Um , well , I was worried that you might be missing Leonard . And that might be causing you to have bad dreams , like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed .
Ah , touch ' .
Right , these theatres have to be eliminated .
Hey , I get it . Everybody wants to spend more time with me . I'm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants .
It's pretty convincing , huh ? And it wasn't even a real person . And here is the clincher . A lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair .
Yes .
Oh , that was a dead end . Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be .
Well , this is ridiculous . Being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything . If I want to resolve this situation , then I need to take action .
Thank you .
Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep , so that they'll be roused by a crying baby . If you want to avoid waking her , speak in a lower register .
I never admit defeat .
All right . In 4D chess '
Anyway , I wanted to apologize . I am truly sorry .
It's called sleep and it's my bedtime . Nighty-night , y'all .
You said it , not me .
Don't . It's terrible . However , in it , we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half , he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar .
Amy has ended our relationship .
You're not listening to my side of it .
Get off there .

ldon :
What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low ?
I should note I'm having some digestive distress , so , if I excuse myself abruptly , don't be alarmed . Oh , a napkin .
Just a few things you may need tonight . There's , uh , baby oil , condoms and , uh , a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology . They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M & M .
Wheaton !
Did you enjoy my lecture ?
I know what this is about . Given the professional standstill you're at , you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching . Yes . And if I may suggest , consider changing disciplines . Yeah , to the humanities , perhaps history . One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things , you know , you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back . You could have fun with that .
Will you stop it . This is a classroom . This is not American Bandstand .
Wait ! You bought me a present ?
Our collaboration is a work of the mind . We don't need desks .
Ah , memory impairment , the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle .
Well , my game is better , ' cause instead of marrying someone , you get to eat them .
Thank you . My mother is very excited . She's convening her Bible study group to listen in , and then pray for my soul .
Da-da-da-da , da-da-da !
I should've brought an umbrella .
Oh , Oh , Lord , that multiplication error ! He thought he carried the one . But he didn't .
What , now , do you have company ?
I'm sorry , I believe you've misunderstood . I'm not giving you the job . I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it . Have a seat , we'll get started with the interview .
When I lie through my teeth to a woman , you nod and agree .
I found him . He's in the bathroom . President Siebert ?
Don't hurt us , don't hurt us ,
Sorry won't bring their kites down . Ow ! String burn ! String burn !
Fine , I'll do it .
I've been cooped up in here too long . Maybe I need some fresh air .
Oh , well .
All right , all right , look , l , let's all , let's remain calm and analyse this situation . Now , I realize that you've only known each other for less than a day , but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced ?
Oh , Leonard . If I was prone to sarcasm , I'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets .
I said the truth . You don't want to live with Leonard , and you know it .
Why would they say at least ? Is it ten toggles ? Is it a hundred toggles ? You know ? Is it a thousand toggles ? Ten thousand toggles ? A hundred thousand toggles ?
All right , what we need now is a tactical retreat . Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth's Athens and Sparta ? Not important . Leonard , Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away , Howard will cover us .
Because you keep saying who .
Well , why should I leave , this is my apartment too .
The key is hidden in my room .
Oh , that's a rather earthy cologne . My uncle used to wear that . Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns .
This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator .
If it makes you feel any better , Amy and I are fine . I mean , really good .
Oh , yes . In fact , I improved upon it .
That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone .
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes , I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured , but patterns emerge , they have their own language if you will .
Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead ?
Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover ?
Mrs . Wunch in fourth grade . And my slogan was a line that's straight is a line that's great .
Well , I'm done with work , so ugh !
Penny , Penny , Penny . Everything you're saying is true , but please allow me to continue . Raj , you're out . The good question , while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group , your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing . How could you , for a moment , think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine ?
All right , let's get right to the vote . Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny .
Ta-da . It's short for da-da-da-da !
I was scared , but I told myself it's just a big bathtub . Then I got scared again ' cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub .
Yeah , but he's dumb , and his face is dumb .
Why ? I really don't understand what's happening here .
We're not stopping .
Oh good ! You're just in time . I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends .
Uh-huh . Interesting . Okay .
Why don't you ask her ?
Well , no , I just , I , I don't want to recycle it . And I don't want store credit .
That's of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes .
Physiologically impossible .
Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery , there was a one-in -700,000 chance of dying ?
Look at you , getting me to engage in the social sciences . You're a vixen , Amy Farrah Fowler .
Damn , this is hard .
Yeah , from when we went to the arcade three years ago ? I finally decided what prize I want . Hurry up .
In that case , may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing ?
I don't see any way to get a park bench in here .
Don't .
Where are you going ?
Oh , pulling strings , are we ?
Run an infra-red repeater , photocell here , emitter here , easy peasy .
What's that ?
If I could keep my Gmail account , I'd be okay with that .
Then why didn't you say that ?
Hello .
I am ? I was wrong . It IS a fear of heights .
Well , that's a fine how-do-you-do . Don't just stand there . Take your breasts out .
Really ? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much .
Okay , Leonard , I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low .
No .
Are you sure ? That would explain so much . Your constant presence in my apartment , that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me , the way you call me sweetie all the time .
So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there .
Yeah , right on , sister .
Well , I wonder if anyone's tried that .
I won't say that all senior citizens who can't master technology should be publicly flogged , but if we made an example of one or two , it might give the others incentive to try harder .
No , Oh , it actually is if you get the joke . It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school .
Sonny and Cher made it work . Their variety show kept going long after the divorce , and here we are still talking about them .
Really , Amy ? Tobacco and alcohol ? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time ?
Okay ? It's magnificent .
I'd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing . Since you and I are both reluctant to go , I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it .
It's not . That's why Leonard does it .
This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous .
What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike ?
How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back ?
What are you implying ?
Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice ?
What would constitute a perfect day for you ?
Yes , that's what I think . And I'm super smart , so it's probably true .
Fine ! Smoot-Cooper . Wow , what a diva .
He wouldn't drive me to work today . I had to wear my bus pants .
For me .
Actually , you can't have that one either . It's too good . Sorry .
Now , don't be insulted . He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious .
Oh , stop . And I believe this is yours . FYI , if you wear that into a bank , they will tackle you to the ground .
It's not optional . We're out of tea . I hope you like bouillon .
So , for all the times I've offended you and all the times that I'll offend you in the future , I'm sorry .
You're kidding , right ? It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton .
Oh , well , you two sit down and get to know each other . I'll get your room ready .
Eight .
You did not break up with Joyce Kim , she defected to North Korea .
Hey , that's my shirt .
You're right . I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you . He played ! He played ! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again . He was okay with that nickname .
Check .
To Sheldon , live long and prosper . Leonard Nimoy .
I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing .
Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective ?
Look on the bright side .
Pacific Daylight time !
No , I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason .
Stand by for my upcoming tat .
If only Penny had said that once in a while .
Wha ? ?
Were you hoping we would because it's prom ?
Well , I was hiding from a bee , but it still counts .
Wait , now , we don't know that yet . He isn't finished . I have a girlfriend and you don't who ?
Captain , what are your orders ?
I know , it's basic culinary science .
I'm sorry . It's not optional .
Not so fast . Infinite Sheldon .
All right . Look , now , this may be the rum talking , but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3 , the Magnus force issue should be negligible .
And every morning .
Luminescence spell .
Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people .
So , she's deceiving me in order to spend more time with me ?
Oh , no . It's not just me . No . The railway is four hours from the nearest airport , and guess who gets to drive me .
ldon : I know what I said . I know what you said . I know what my mother said on March 5 , 1992 . What is the sixth noble gas ?
Oh . I'll just take one last sip . Ah .
Come .
I'll reprogram Howard .
Grape . I find it the most mild .
And you'll text me when you arrive at the airport ?
You're right . That was insensitive of me . I have to go back to my table now . You should join us .
Yeah , even that . You look like a dork .
Okay , that's it , I don't know how , but she is cheating . No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game .
Alright Kripke , that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together . Tomorrow . Yes , I'll pay . Alright , goodbye . Alright ! Time to learn rock climbing .
Yeah , I never cared for that . It's advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are .
Don't feel bad . Neither does he .
This must feel pretty good for you , coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut .
Aaaah !
No , I hate them , but it gets worse . There it is .
Oh , no , no , no , well now , there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening .
What are you doing here ?
Good news . I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess .
She watched it . I'm gonna get that girl back .
Yes , it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality .
Hmm .
Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce .
Oh , Dear Lord , more rules ? Where does it stop ? Can I want to go because I have to want to go ?
Thank you . They're my mother's .
No , that's my potty training journal .
Oh , don't be offended . You know , of the four of us , you have the most veal-like consistency .
I have many . My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny . That's her over there .
Really ?
Are you sure this is what you want to do ?
It's okay , I stopped being upset about that . And no , the irony is not lost on me .
The water level rose .
No , no , of course you have to publish . That's your responsibility as a scientist . Doing otherwise would be unethical . You have no choice .
See ?
This isn't fair . You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny .
I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip , and I'm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement .
Oh , I feel closer to you , too . You know , it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime .
So , that's what you wear to an interview ?
Well it's a game of the imagination , Leonard . Paint a picture .
Hello .
Raiders of the Lost Ark , with 21 additional seconds . If I can't see it , no one else can see it .
I'll get them .
Of course . Would you like to join me for Chinese food ?
Your first date ? Did you even measure her walls ?
And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises , very thoughtful . Warm milk , Penny ?
Individual relish packets ?
Not lima beans , carbon atoms .
He's not wrong . Alright , and this is my office .

Very well . You seem to be headed somewhere . May I walk with you ?
I didn't say it was fascinating , I said it was noteworthy .
Wowza .
It's fun for ages eight to eighty . Join us .
That's an excellent idea . Yeah , if we chat , it will create the illusion of time going faster .
I think I'll eat my lunch at home .
Hello , Leonard . Oh , hello , Arthur . What an odd coincidence that you're both here .
Yes , please . Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered .
Good night .
Correct .
Of course I do . The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me . It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year .
Well then buckle up , in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby .
You don't really believe in that superstition , do you ?
There's no way .
I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try ? Or in your case the old community college try ?
I see . Take me to Leonard .
So what exactly do you want us to do ?
Sure you can , you're doing fine , it's very believable .
That's probably my fault . She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume .
I can't . I'm naked .
Leonard , please . His mother just died .
