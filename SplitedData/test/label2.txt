That's great .
You want to hear something weird ?
Oh , hey . You're back . How was your trip ?
Are you gonna introduce me to your friend ?
I doubt it .
Oh , like yesterday , when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners , the pharmacy and the post office ?
Read it back one more time .
Just ignore him .
Why a turtle ?
Priya and I are in love . I think we could get married someday .
I don't care . She's upset , I'm going over there .
I know , and there's no excuse for that .
Uh , y-yeah .
You think they'll still go on the trip ?
Fine .
I'm just saying , if we fake got back together , that's totally not how it fake happened .
Good night , Sheldon .
We're leaving now !
You don't know your own husband's birthday .
Aw , the pet store ?
Actually , you did do one of them together .
Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die , or is that just nature's way ?
Hang on . When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart ?
Leave it alone . That's my girlfriend .
Oh , hang on a second .
Howard , every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts . They see me coming they go ' ah , no peanut boy ! '
Swell . I need a drink . Do we have any alcohol ?
Yes
Oh , Penny , you don't want to get into it with Sheldon . The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain .
Of course . Out of respect .
Me-wow .
Alright .
Congratulations , Sheldon . You win office .
Sorry , somebody's sitting there .
May I ask why ?
You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley ?
Oh , the girls really did a nice job .
Oh come on , no ! We just bought the regular pack .
No , that was a different guy .
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little ?
Why ? They're state-of-the-art digital projection , 20 - channel surround sound .
Why are you introducing yourself ?
I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren .
So we won't let it get weird .
If that's so , what if I start talking to a girl ?
Damn his Vulcan hearing . Not a good time , Sheldon .
No kidding .
What ? Why ?
All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group . A potential close friend and ' perhaps more . I don't want to look like a dork .
You don't honestly think that , do you ?
There was one time I put body glitter on .
Right .
Okay , so if I remain calm , I'll get more gems like turn off the lights ?
nard : Is this it ?
That's great , I'm happy for you .
Face it , you can't stump me . I am the king of husbands . I know that you don't like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine's Day . I know you hate the word moist . I know '
Sure , no problem .
No , no , I'm good . If my P . E . teachers had told me this is what I was training for , I would have tried a lot harder .
You see those , too .
No , no that's the past . I'm really more of a right now kind of guy . You know , living in the moment . Although I do have to live a little in the future , ' cause , well , that's my job . Of course , my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards , but those stories often take place in the future . In conclusion , no , it doesn't bother me .
Here's your tee-shirt .
No one's a scientist like Howard .
Well , great .
It doesn't matter . I'm the king of foreplay .
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago .
She's an enigma , Raj .
It gets better . Instead of me , you can take someone who will actually enjoy it .
Uh , I'm just gonna be honest with the guy .
You don't think it's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science .
I guess it depends on the zombies , Raj . Are we talking slow zombies , fast zombies ? Like , in 28 Days , if those zombies didn't eat , they starved .
Did I miss anything ? Did they kick Giselle off ?
That a problem ?
That's not helping .
Laser's warmed up .
Fine , you win . You're a bitch . Why couldn't we just have a nice time ?
So , what do you say ?
Sheldon ? Hello ?
I move we are the Army Ants , all those in favour ?
When you left , you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter , so we came up with kind of a cool solution .
Hey .
Okay , well , I ju ' I think it's important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and ' oh , shoot , I had it !
They'd say , why does he touch himself so much ?
Yeah , you got me . I'm a Leibniz man .
What ?
Hi , Kurt .
Well , I want to go get my asthma inhaler , but it might ruin the moment . Just , just help me out here . How does a miserable date end in sex ?
I'm ' uh ' in a ' I'm in a radiation suit . What's up ?
Sheldon , there are a million great vacations you could take . What about Hawaii ?
No , I can't eat melon .
So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart ?
Nicely done , Howard .
Well , sometimes there's a secret ending , like in The Avengers .
Yeah . If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country , do you know what they would have said ?
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word ?
We're not fighting .
Maybe .
Pretty good .
Mm-hmm . Yep . I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood .
Awesome !
It would blow up .
Yeah , he's fine , he's just a little rattled .
I'm sure Mrs . Florida's walking funny . Can we get back to work ?
By the way , if anyone asks , the elevator shaft always had a tree in it .
No , I can't look at you or your avatar right now .
Penny's up .
It never is , is it ?
Are you sure ? I'd really like to .
I honestly don't remember .
So ?
Just tell me .
Uh , no . Oh , this is Zack . He's a friend of ours . Zack , this is Stuart . He owns the store .
Sure .
Oh , absolutely .
Oh , uh , we're making nano vacuum tubes .
Oh , come on . The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically .
No kidding , you speak English really well .
What's going on with you ?
Move out .
That's ridiculous .
I would have asked you . In my head . On the way home . While I was having a good cry .
Howard '
Well ' I don't know what to say .
Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her .
Okay , you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here .
Nope , just , just , whoa .
You okay ?
So , is that your team .
Yeah . I got a dressmaker's mannequin , I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm , and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back .
Yeah , but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play .
Where is everything ?
What ?
No , no , it doesn't matter , we'll be at work .
Thank you .
Still digging the Shamy ?
Hey .
I'm sorry , but facts are facts .
Working it ? You can't even talk to her .
You know , thanks for closed-captioning my pain , Raj .
Hey , uh , listen , everybody . Before Howard gets here , et's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father .
I don't know . Foreplay ?
Sheldon , I'm not alone in here .
Uh , that's a great question , Zack .
Sheldon ? I just dropped him off at the comic book store . Why ?
Is that who I think it is ?
Oh , hey , buddy . How'd it go ?
Okay , Sheldon , what do you want me to do , hide the information ? If I don't publish it , it's just a matter of time before someone else does .
See what ?
Are you sure this is right ?
Well , he doesn't live at Walmart , but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter . And that's the same man who complains you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter .
Let me refresh your memory .
How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality ?
Really ?
Mm . I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You ? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk .
Ah , don't . If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds , they shouldn't have started a sci-fi channel .
Who is it ?
What are you doing hiding back there ?
Okay , I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is , but , I'm pretty sure she is a prostitute .
No , it's a drinking game . Whenever we see an iceberg , we take a shot !
Howard's space toilet . I'll tell you later .
Well , maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer .
Message received . Ah , excuse me . ( Answering phone ) Hello . This is Dr . Hofstadter . Okay . All right , thank you . That's weird . I'm getting called in to Human Resources .
You know , before you got all swollen up , I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party .
You know what , guys , I'm not in the mood for paintball . What do you say we just bag it ?
She fixed your equation .
Okay , I am setting the dials for January 10
Oh , b-be careful . Give him some line . Okay , now reel him in .
I wasn't gonna get beat up .
Yeah , I just stopped by to say '
Yeah ?
Okay , let's try it this way . Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said ' what was that ? What did you say ? Oh , yes , you said you owed me one .
Okay , now , do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card ?
No , but you're right . I should march over there and ask her out .
And you actually got in a pool ?
I'm sorry , Sheldon .
Hey , Lesley .
You're surprised ? Your psychic didn't tell you I was going to be a jerk ?
Wait a minute , what's the plan here ? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married , what's he going to do , stay drunk for the rest of his life ?
Okay , fasten your seat belt .
I'm sorry , don't listen to him . We're actually physicists . We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today . We just , we had some time to kill .
It's a splatter thing . There's a little piece of tape on the floor you're supposed to stand behind .
Well , look at that . Burned a whole calorie .
Hang on , hang on , do you not realise what we just did .
How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria ?
If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon , we can try marriage counselling .
Stupid idea .
No problem .
You're not going to Switzerland !
Look , I am in the Halo battle of my life here , there's this kid in Copenhagen , he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7 .
Buddy , I , I think you might be overreacting .
What for ?
I wasn't swinging around a pole .
He's not lying , he does find that fascinating .
Sheldon , it's not that bad .
Doctor doctor . Surgical resident . Smart , pretty . Let me ask you something . If your friend thinks he's dating someone , but he's not because , in fact , you're dating her , does that make you a bad person ?
Yeah , I really didn't think this through .
Alicia is an actress , just like you .
Hey .
We don't mean to interrupt , we live across the hall .
You don't have to come if you don't want to .
Because we didn't want to be disturbed .
Yeah , sure . You owe me .
Uh , I don't know . They're pretty different .
Oh , yeah , there she is . Hi , Mom .
Yes .
Look , I admit it , I may have crossed a line here , but come on , Raj , your sister is a grown woman . To her , I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate .
Ooh ! Sorry , I thought you were gonna do that .
Are you actually gonna dance ?
He's Glissinda the troll .
Well , there's nothing you can do about it , so relax , sit back , enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails .
Calm down . I'm getting out . I have something I want to give you .
No way .
It's okay . You didn't know . I'll take care of it .
Doesn't sound that bad .
Um , since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer ?
A tribe of Abra-Comanches .
Invite them to live with us .
No , I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar .
Oh . I'll be there .
No you don't . He doesn't .
Your company ?
Okay , we used to go out , right ?
Can you please talk to him ?
I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses .
All right , here you go .
We're out of ice .
What ?
Seriously ? You haven't used this desk in years . The second I want to get rid of it , you're up here working ?
Okay . You need to get clear on this right now . I am in charge of this project .
I know exactly what we are gonna do .
Look , here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon . He's the worst .
Interesting . Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB . What's KBB ?
Hey , a toast . Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project . And please know that we could not have done it without you , so cheers .
Lesley , this is Penny , she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me .
No , it's more of a relentless , narcissistic drone .
Oh , I know what he's saying , and he's not , he's not funny .
Oh , who am I kidding , I can't go through with this , you need to call her and cancel .
No , I , I mean , it was good . There were just a few things that needed a little polishing .
Yes , but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday .
She's gone , Sheldon .
Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland ?
Come on . It's just a cup of coffee .
Okay . Star Trek , the original series , the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds . Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same .
What is it ?
Where's Penny ?
Excuse me ?
Hold on . So , your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up ?
And that's a lie , right ?
That's weird .
We're pinned down .
So , how are your mom and dad ?
Well , maybe not , but some day we actually will be old , and we'll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had .
Oh , yeah ? What about it ?
What ?
Here you go .
It's an annual science conference . We've all been invited to speak .
No .
Hey .
Shooting at a target ?
Well , maybe you should tell him .
One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten . I meant , golly , Sheldon , you've been gone a long time .
I know it only takes one doctor's finger .
Wait , did you say wait ?
Anyway , Amy , thank you for sticking up for me .
You understand why I'm doing this to you ?
Zazzles ?
Yes , I do . The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them , and I wanted to have sex . To this day , I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused .
Maybe since you're so good , he's taking his time to meet the challenge . I want Penny to enjoy school '
That sounds lovely .
I mean , you could say thank you . I did just buy you a car .
No , he lives here now .
No .
Hey , watch your speed . I hear the Mexican police target tourists .
Okay , I'm out of here .
Okay , listen to me , this is just a minor setback .
I hope so .
Oh , then , I think you'll appreciate what I got you .
I honestly don't .
Of course you're not . People love trained monkeys .
So , the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas .
I believe you .
They're gonna get beaten up at that club .
When we watch Frosty the Snowman , he roots for the sun .
Because of you , I'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home . I'm not allowed to whistle . I don't wear shoes that might squeak .
They're gonna find out about me eventually , right ?
Please be good . Please be good . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Okay . She writes like she cooks .
It's , whatever . Ten , eleven dollars .
You're too close to it , but Amy has had a huge impact on you .
Hey , I've got a good job . I could buy salmon . You don't know .
You know , I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can't score with . I think I'll let you two take this one .
And there's your damsel .
Mr . Jeffries , I'm , I'm Leonard . This is my girlfriend , Penny .
Okay , I'd better go in there and talk to him .
This has to mean something .
I just said , couples sound great .
Why not ?
Okay , I'm hanging up now . You know there's no such thing as a k '
I'll friend you on Facebook .
Ah !
Well , now , hold on . What kind of distance are we talking about ? Because we are neighbours . I mean , I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment .
Excuse me , could you help us out ?
Listen , I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea .
Buddy , I'm so sorry . Is there anything I can do ?
I have to get a lock for my door .
Hang on . Black beans , not pinto beans ?
Hey , you guys are talking again . Good . What happened ?
Aw , hell , I miss him .
That sounds nice . Yeah .
Oh . Yeah , okay .
Okay , then we won't touch the hard drive . We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar .
nard : Telling you ? Telling you .
Excuse me .
No , a time machine from Sophie's Choice .
Who wouldn't ?
Relax , it wasn't your fault .
Oh . We're scientists .
Oh , how will we ever get used to the new you ?
I'm not pressuring you .
What's up ?
Is that a pregnancy test ?
Got you a little something , too .
Stop it , you're gonna make me cry . All right . You seem pretty confident .
No . Sheldon , why didn't you tell me ?
And it helps to have small , delicate fingers . So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast as me and Howard .
Still , I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and ' you know ' move on with my life .
Oh , I don't know . Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend , you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed .
Yes .
Okay , well , I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work . You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend , Dr . Plimpton , who you just met . It'll be fun . Like a clown car .
Mmm . My pleasure .
Yeah . But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything .
They slept together , Sherlock .
I don't know . I heard you reading pretty loud last night .
Our pleasure .
Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys ?
How so ?
What do you want , a medal ? It was your gum .
Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend .
No , you're done . I want you out of my apartment right now .
You don't know my birthday , do you ?
You know , let's just come up with something new .
Kites , ho !
Oh , no . No , come on . I have a friend in you . You said so .
Not only did Sheldon save my life , he didn't rat me out to the landlord . Or the police . Or Homeland Security .
Ignore him . Yeah , sorry about the breakup .
Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball ?
Well , have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two .
Sheldon ?
What brought this on ?
Oh , no .
So ?
Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger . Put it anywhere you like .
Wow . Wouldn't think there'd be that many .
Still arguing over which CSI is the best ?
What ?
That's true .
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing . I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not . Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him , he made me floss with my own shoelaces .
What do you want .
Why don't we go get the food for the party .
No offence , but I've known the guy a really long time .
It's kind of a fashionable look these days .
What ?
Well , to be fair , you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me .
Okay , this is getting a little hard to not take personally .
What happened ?
I'm in bed !
Okay . Well , then I'll read it to you . It's from the day we first met . Beauty , thy name is Penny .
She's heard about you because we're , you know , involved and you haven't heard about her because ' I never slept with her , I swear !
You won't believe it , the military confiscated our project .
Not yet .
I feel awful .
Thank you . And now I owe you one .
Anyway , we followed the guy to this garage sale , and they had the coolest stuff .
There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner . Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed , so , to clarify here , by dinner I mean supper .
Okay .
Okay , let's get clear on something . We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way . No one's bat'lething anybody .
You're right . I'm fine . I'm wearing this .
Just let it go , Sheldon .
Oshikuru : Demon Samurai .
Instead of dwelling on the negative , think about this . Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity , which gives you an opportunity to show her that you're a loving and supportive boyfriend .
So , did you love it ? Of course you loved it . How could you not love it ? Tell me how much you loved it .
Was there a plan B ?
What are you doing ?
Huh ? Some of this ? And , since it's Thanksgiving , an extra helping of this ?
Really ? LeVar Burton's coming here ?
I don't know what that means .
I was thinking , we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition , and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine . You just use your smartphone , take a picture of the equation and bam !
Hey , she didn't compromise . She settled . There's a difference .
You're not gonna need wingman , you're gonna need a paramedic .
Uh , okay .
Again , no offence , but so have I .
Really ?
Really ? Brent Spiner , Mr . Data himself . You love him .
Mm-hmm , International Space Station . 250 miles that way .
All right , Mother . Um , have a nice flight .
Okay , Mom , you sit over there .
ard : I'm gonna do it . I'm gonna ask her out .
All right , I tried .
The old Unabomber approach . Kudos .
Okay , let's focus . The girls are gone , we have 48 hours . There are no distractions . Let's change the world .
Well , it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase , I can tell you that .
I don't have a vet . I have a podiatrist , an optometrist , an allergist , a dermatologist , a urologist . You'd think I'd have a vet .
What are you doing in there ?
Can I whistle ?
Aaargh .
I don't know . Texas ?
So , Mrs . Cooper , what did you think of the sushi ?
Hey , we're all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar . You want to come ?
Yeah , it's just one sneeze . (
Do you realise that if Penny wakes up , there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here ?
You want to talk about it ?
No . What happened ?
I'm kidding , I want you to feel at home here . Decorate it any way that makes you happy .
Sheldon , I'm so sorry I dragged you through this .
Yes ! For God's sake , Sheldon , do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth .
Great topic . I can help with that . There are lots of different perspectives you can take , economic , sociological , political .
Yeah .
Hey .
You're asking me out ?
You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab .
Why ? What are they doing ?
The man restocking the cereal shelves .
If we find my backup inhaler , maybe we can get frisky .
Huh .
Sheldon ! We're working here !
It was the best apartment I'd seen , the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way .
Oh . Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim .
Sheldon , I don't need an alibi . Nobody's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip .
It'd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day .
Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone . I am really sorry about this .
And there goes our hike .
Actually , no , he goes to the bathroom at eight a . m . with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays .
Fine . You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn't bother to ask me first .
Maybe she's his lawyer .
No , it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage . Pretty Christmassy .
No , the problem isn't solved . He just blew us off .
Okay , I get it .
ard : Coming .
When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms ?
We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay .
What ?
A scientist made that .
Well , congrats , and it's nice you're gonna be there for your sister .
And you were right about my motives , I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex .
What ?
Penny is an amazing shot . I think we have a real chance to win this week .
How about this , are you familiar with the typical development for computer software ?
Can't be very long .
What ?
Yeah . He's ganged up .
Sure . You're living here for free , I guess I owe you .
So much .
The what ?
Oh . Football , sure .
That'll be all . That was fun .
So , are we ever gonna hang out with this girl ?
Are you kidding me ? After all we've been through , I just want to go home .
I wonder if there's a way we could give the idea a trial run .
I prefer to think of myself as five-ten , but I still need to get all my pants hemmed .
Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug .
Yeah , I'm a frickin ' genius .
What , you mean , like , your massive credit card debt ?
It's hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do .
If we do , I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy .
Because he's hard to find . If he was easy to find , the books would be called There's Waldo .
Well , this is it , this is it . This is it .
Sorry . Whatever . It's all good .
Forget the sword , Sheldon , help Raj .
Penny , you're always welcome to stay with us .
Waugh , romance ninja .
Calling 911 .
Yeah . No matter what happens , we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again .
Hello , boys .
Fine . You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen . There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water .
Okay , how do I look ?
Okay , uh , how do I put this ? Um , are you familiar with Darwin's observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands ?
Affirmative , with fever .
I'm just saying , sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside .
Sheldon , I got you your tangerine chicken . I hope you're hungry .
There's not ? Gee , cos it sure sounds like there should be .
No . I did have a shot with the Lisatronic , but the extension cord wasn't long enough .
I'll take a look at it .
Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room . Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand ?
Okay . Where were we ?
Is my coitus whimsically inventive ?
Monday morning I'll go downtown , look up the owner's information and send him the DVD . Pay the late fee , and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic . Ah !
What ?
Maybe a little .
Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot .
Fine , take the plant .
Howard , relax , I'm not interested in your girlfriend .
Howard , Raj and I just had a team meeting .
Fine .
I really do .
Hey , listen , I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend , but then I wondered , because we're in this relationship-beta-test , if I should have asked you first . Then I thought if I did check with you first , you'd think that I was taking things to seriously . And then , then I got a nosebleed .
Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue ?
Well , the last three nights I've had to take him to get a haircut , to the train store , and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen . Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone .
Couple of weirdos . Why ?
Believe it or not , he was worse when I met him .
Are you having trouble sleeping ? ' Cause , boy , I was up all night .
Oh , now he's a genius ? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering .
Yeah , so ?
I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's . I think Howard's going to be there . You want to join us ?
Yeah . We should do it more often .
So , Rebecca , how did you become a personal trainer ?
Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam ?
Sure .
I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man .
He does raise an interesting point .
We all make mistakes , let's move on .
Hey , Amy , what brings you to our neck of the woods ?
Maybe we should take a step back .
We are not blackmailing Peter J ' All right , where's the ring ?
That's the definition of being a know-it-all .
It's Leonard .
No .
I'm ' uh ' at work .
What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely .
Look , I get it , and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do .
That's great , but I ' .
Actually , your name is on the electric bill .
No . Steve Patterson told me .
If it were your head , it would be .
Sure . Oh , god , you smell so good . Of course , that could just be my other senses getting stronger . Hypothetically , if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform , would you wear it ?
I also love you .
Yeah .
Calm down , we'll make the movie .
I don't know . It's a fat guy on a Segway . That's funny everywhere .
Pretty sure .
Oh , ' I love it . Oh , that's great !
I gotta go .
Fine , I'll publish .
Buddy , I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change , but it's not .
How's your mom holding up ?
Come on . I take care of him all day long . You do it for once .
I know it's not ideal , but don't let them ruin our night .
Oh , the pleasure is mine , Mr . Innovative . Uh , another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking . Do you hear that , Mr . Out-Of-The ?
Short Round ?
I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety .
Lesley and I do research together at the University .
Hey .
Okay , now , this is ridiculous !
I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff . What are we gonna do here ?
So , that sounds more like something you'd say if you didn't want a relationship with someone . This isn't working out , but I'll always have feelings for you . I'm sorry I slept with your best friend , but I'll always have feelings for you . Here's the thing , Lisa , I'm into dudes now , but I'll always have feelings for you .
Uh-huh . The viewing area's right over there . Sheldon , your girl ' date ' person ' Ramona's here .
Thanks , Wyatt . I'm a keeper .
To the bedroom .
No , it's not '
Thank you .
What ?
What happened ?
Come on , Sheldon , please teach me about football . It'll be fun .
Aw .
Where on earth did you get that from ?
Not on Blu-ray . Only twice on Blu-ray .
Oh . You know , I'm really starting to not like this guy .
It was Penny's boyfriend's , they broke up .
Like what ?
It was not a crisis . Apparently , I favoured the left one , she got a little lopsided .
You're gonna have to be more specific .
Very comforting . Okay , so what do I say to her ?
What's wrong with a football jersey ?
No .
When is the time ?
I really don't know .
Yeah , maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff .
Thank you . What did she mean , she's happy for me ? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone , or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy , because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy , even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy . You know , because the second person , though happy , is now romantically unavailable to the first person .
I couldn't say that , I would have to say , you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again .
There you go , she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport , aAnd I can't play ' cause I'm going with her , right ?
Here it is . There's a black light .
It's not bold , it's a mistake . I didn't change my status .
What's he on trial for ?
Oh , we really need to get you a girl .
No . Sulfites . Migraines .
That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come .
Just think . Thanks to your hard work , an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
Do I get some sympathy now ?
You guys all right ?
Uh , I guess I am .
I don't know . Sometimes your movements are so lifelike , I forget you're not a real boy .
That doesn't sound right . My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging .
Ready .
Yeah , if you like that type .
Thank you .
I'll see you later . I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny .
Thanks . You , too . You know , go ahead and take it .
I don't really go by Lenny , but that's okay . Um , you remember Sheldon , Howard and Raj .
The two aren't mutually exclusive !
Trust me , you'll be fine . See ya .
You're welcome . How's your fish ?
Because I can't breathe . I snore , I get sinus infections .
Believe it or not , personal growth . What happened ?
Laxative .
Amy broke up with Sheldon .
Gee , uh '
Guys , please don't make this a school project where I'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch .
Ah , you're going off the grid .
We don't order egg rolls .
I am here , right ? You see me .
Absolutely .
I'm trying to think of an answer that won't stop you from doing this .
Fourteen dollars , huh ?
You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise .
Yeah , well , when I die , you can rent a bounce house .
Nothing , I'm fine .
Thank you .
No , no , it's fine . I don't care . I'm over it .
Howard , listen to me .
That's kind of between me and '
Yeah .
We're not living together .
Oh , uh , he's crazy .
Are you ashamed of me ?
That's it . Bye-bye .
Oh , yay for me . What about you guys ? I can't promise anything , but people do make money off stuff like this .
God , I love you . I love you so much .
What are you working on ?
Sheldon , what are you doing ?
Yeah , sure , why not .
Sheldon , this is not your home .
I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies . Instead , it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again .
Wow .
No , I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time .
Well , now be careful , these are hot . i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust , but instead I'm gonna keep it to myself .
Bye Missy , see you .
Thank you .
Like what ?
Oh , come on !
Why would you do that ?
So you guys were testing us both ? What is the matter with you ?
No , it's not crazy it's , uh , uh , it's a paradox . And paradoxes are part of nature , think about light . Now if you look at Huygens , light is a wave , as confirmed by the double slit experiments , but then , along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too . Well , I didn't make it worse .
Hadn't really thought about it .
Absolutely . If you admit that you're a 30 - year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own .
Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice .
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa .
Lactose .
Yes .
Well , I can do without the 40 - minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life .
Hey .
Hi .
I'm gonna get some coffee . You want some ?
You know , if no one's thought of this , yet , this could be a big deal .
You did everything you could .
As I was saying '
You make a lot of sense . I like this table , and I'm getting it .
Anythingforagreencard.com ?
So what ? It's the same food .
You're sure it's good ?
Oh , don't say that . You're a very attractive woman .
Did she think you were choking or ' I'm sorry , that's great . Thank you for spending time with her .
Okay . Good luck .
Seems a shame to throw it away .
Oh , he was upset . So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage .
What can I tell you ? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there .
All right , do it . Call him . Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished .
I'm sorry . Can we please just do it one more time ?
Please let it go , Sheldon .
Mm , dreamily doodling Mrs . Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook ?
There , see ? Problem solved .
Don't you dare , missy .
Mmm , would you like some wine ?
What , to you , is a large crowd ?
There's Howard's rocket , live from Kazakhstan .
94 seconds .
Pretty cool about Howard , huh ?
What ? Why ?
Hmmm .
nard : Ooh , it's time for Babylon 5 !
Blue and yellow make green .
Okay , next question , for the Butterfinger . How long is a galactic yea
I'm sorry .
It's okay . Did the right thing . You idiot !
Yeah , for a little while .
Yes . Um , is this the High IQ sperm bank ?
Oh , God .
This game's dangerous . I could get you in trouble .
How come you're not doing a mission ? You're just wandering around .
Even Batman breaks the rules .
Yes , but our society has undergone a paradigm shift , in the information age , Sheldon , you and I are the alpha males . We shouldn't have to back down .
What about you , Raj ?
Well , I'd like to be green , but you know you always take it .
Oh , yeah , no , sure , go ahead .
Oh , hey , on a related subject , are you embarrassed to have me around your friends ?
So , we're still getting married ?
Yeah , sure .
Okay , is everyone clear on the plan ?
No , last time that old lady in the park kept screaming , watch out , he's right behind you . Hello ?
Screw you guys . I'm gonna go see if she's home .
Again , I'm sorry . You know , with Howard and Bernadette getting married , I got caught up in a little wedding fever . I take it back .
Can't argue with that . I'll get the tickets .
So by friend , do you mean friend friend , gay friend , or ex boyfriend who you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend ' ?
And you're starting out with Sheldon Cooper . That's like getting your first pet and having it be , I don't know , what's a kind of pet that ruins your life ?
I think we're all talking to Penny here .
I'm okay .
You know what ? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement . Let's make a pact . When one of us gets their first big breakthrough , we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott .
You can stop smiling now .
Are you even listening to me ?
Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot .
Agreed , what's your point ?
Let's see . What's young and fun ? Uh , we could go dancing .
Really ?
What's going on ?
Oh , Sheldon , I'm sure it's not because they don't think you're an elite scientist .
What do you want to do ?
What are you talking about , the date went fine .
They seem okay with it .
I think her weekend just opened up .
You're awful quiet , everything okay ?
Come on ! There's over 200 questions . And look at some of these things . Sheldon is to camaraderie , as the space shuttle is to blank ?
I mean , I'm a perfectly nice guy . There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner . Maybe take a walk afterwards , talk about things we have in common , ' you love pottery ? I love pottery ! ' You know , there's a pause , we both know what's happening , I lean in , we kiss , it's a little tentative at first but then I realise , she's kissing me back , and she's biting my lower lip , you know , she wants me , this thing is going the distance , we're going to have sex ! Oh God ! Oh , my God !
Hey .
It's too small and too perfect .
He's okay ?
Only ten hours , 55 minutes to go .
Oh , not junior rodeo . What did you do ?
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted .
Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine .
Please don't be mad .
Well , with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie ,
And bring you home . So , why don't you pack up your stuff and we'll head back .
Oh , damn it !
Listen , guys , I'm sorry , I don't mean to be rude , but I need to go call Raj's sister , who I love so much . So vastly much .
He's at the train station .
Are you really admitting defeat ?
Yeah , toddlers do that .
He was the host of this great ' Hey !
Don't .
I'm sorry things turned out this way .
I don't know how you put up with it . He's impossible . I mean , holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy .
No .
Waah . I don't want a table .
Me , neither . Except for one night when the heat went out . Long story , it's ' don't ask .
So ?
Well , funny story . So , we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder , but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead '
Why would you open mine ?
Uh , sure .
Snipe !
Hey . Just playing a little Giant Jenga here .
So ?
Oh , okay , yeah , hang on a sec .
You did go pfft .
I'm so proud of you .
That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you .
I just ate , aren't you supposed to wait an hour ?
Maybe along the z-axis , but x and y are looking pretty sad .
Sheldon .
It was good , good . Just out of curiosity , what time do you usually go to bed ?
Stitches ? With a needle ?
It's a blanket with sleeves .
Fine .
I don't know , I just got a text . Come on , hurry .
No , Sheldon , there's not going to be a scene . There's two of us and one of him .
Ah , it was all right , I guess . Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon . Caught Raj right in the eye .
And who got him to try a turkey dog ?
Fine , don't tell me .
No , that's okay .
Yeah , I can see how that would ' a bunch of people ?
W-w-wuh , no , no , hang on , uh , uh , roommate agreement . No hootenannies , sing-a-longs , or barbershop quartets after ten p . m .
Is it possible we're having two different conversations ?
That was kind of icy . You two okay ?
No .
Yes , he is .
Reconstituted Thai food .
So a few things don't go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo ?
That's great , but the Air Force approved the specs . We're good to go .
I gotta say , I am really impressed . This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even .
Sit down .
No , it's not gonna do it .
No , he didn't .
Hey , here's a thought . Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs ?
We covered this , I'm dumb .
Okay , we need to talk .
You shut the loading doors , right ?
We did not . That's not true . Can I speak to you alone for a second ?
Yeah , but I already saw him naked . Just come here .
Since when ?
If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up , we'd be set .
Excellent .
They zip him up in that bag .
Aw .
It's relatively new . I just know that I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like simply to have a girlfriend . I'm okay on my own .
Oh , come on , that's got to count . There was a really strong undertow , we could have died .
Nevertheless , I'd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did .
Eh , uh , well , I was wondering , if you're not too busy , um , uh , if , if you'd be interested in telling me where the restroom is ?
I heard of ' em . Didn't know they were a band . Sheldon , she's gone . You can turn off the blender .
Hot dogs .
Sheldon , be nice .
You want to prepare him ? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself .
Yeah .
Wait a minute , you have a guy ?
No , it's just something I threw on .
Yeah , you're right . That is the term I'm looking for . You are a dirty double mother suckler .
He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes , and wants to know if I'd take a look at it .
Look , Sheldon , I know it's in the agreement , and if you turn into a zombie , I promise I will not kill you . In fact , I'll even let you eat my brains . But I am taking Penny to Switzerland .
What the hell is wrong with you ?
So tell him to apologize .
So we already have you for all that .
Well , what is it ?
Wait , Sheldon gave me a banana in a box . He was testing me , too .
Well , did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work ?
Hey .
Good .
No .
I'm sorry . That I asked .
She let me .
I don't care what you guys think , Stephanie and I are very happy living together . I will give either of you 20 dollars , right now to trade pants with me .
They're running a little behind . Should be pretty soon .
You think you should call Amy ?
A hobby ?
Yeah , okay , I see him . It looks like they're having a nice time . I wish I could hear what they're saying .
Is someone sick ?
Well , unless he's makes one out of wood like Gepetto , I don't think it's gonna happen .
Wait , I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen ! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers .
Good , I'm glad .
How ridiculous is he ?
You called on him .
Slow down . Two hundred .
Oh , yeah . Mouth-to-Mouth Mona . You know , she used to date Howard ?
Sacks , sacks '
Why didn't you tell me ?
I'm sorry . I was just trying to help .
Oh , yeah . No . Thanks , that would be great help . You realize you might kill some of them .
Well , it's not across the hall .
We owe you an apology .
Okay . Great . How do you want to start ?
I'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself .
Okay .
See ya . Still can't believe she's going out with me .
I hate to say it , but she did kind of betray you .
So , well , before making any rash '
I'm not a big fan of musicals , but I love that show .
Well , yeah , sex with you is pretty great . Have you ever tried it ?
More .
Maybe it's a shipping problem .
Aw , that used to work with Sheldon .
Wha ' how did it get on the internet ?
I told you my plan . Let's call Building Services and get help .
Face it , Raj , we crashed and burned tonight .
What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married ?
Hey , you got a minute ?
Oh . This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life ?
You know what , I'm being ridiculous . But who cares what Penny thinks , Lesley is a terrific girl , she's attractive , we like each other , she's extremely intelligent .
Excuse me ?
Superceded !
What do you got ?
No , I think it's a firmware problem .
He startles easily , so , please , no flash photography .
Yeah , sure .
Are you sure ?
I'm not saying that .
I'm sorry , duh , what ?
Public restroom kit . Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places .
Got it . Bye .
Oh , you heard ?
When I take a girl out on a date , and I do , she knows she's been dated . Capital D . Bold face , underline , like Day-ted . I think I might have a little concussion , I'm going to go lay down for a while , good night .
These are pretty god , what flavour is this ?
Did you just quote Star Wars ?
Uh-huh .
Skee-Ball tickets ?
Oh !
Snort it down and keep eating !
What are you guys doing ?
Yeah , it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost .
It's kind of a dream come true .
I don't know .
Oh , no . I wish you'd told me that sooner .
I said no .
Well , I was doing some government research at the time , you know , military , rocket fuel . It's kind of secret .
He tried to take nude photos of you ?
Fun , I've never been there .
I really like you , but I want to see how things go with Mark ?
Sounds good .
I'm still confused .
No , no , no , no .
Bye .
No , you listen . You're my woman , and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before .
Sorry .
Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight . We're reading the reviews .
A lackey ?
Uh , I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be .
Really ? You're just gonna let me go by myself ?
Howard , just come in here .
I don't know anything about show business , so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings , I'm sure you know what you're doing .
What do you guys want to do tonight ?
Yeah .
I don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch .
Shouldn't we talk to him ? Have you learned nothing in six years ?
Okay , well , good luck with it .
Fine , go ahead .
Appreciate that , too .
Mm-hmm . For two of us , it's in the right direction .
This is brilliant , Sheldon . How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office ?
Okay , I'm sorry .
Well , you stay as long as you'd like .
My money's on tuck and roll .
Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space ?
Should I say something ? I feel like I should say something .
Um , I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there .
What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart ?
Well , it's always me , take one for the team .
I never thought I'd say these words , but come on , nose spider .
A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper .
What are you gonna do ?
Look at you , being all mature .
Oh , careful . That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit .
Oh . Sorry , we can't .
Oh . Well , I have some work to do , so '
Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine ?
I don't want to fly kites , Sheldon . We're watching football here .
In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away .
You know , you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette .
Mm . I know how you feel . I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career , and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking .
I've got my helm of lordly might , my boots of speed , and if things get too exciting , my inhaler of asthma .
Sheldon , I think I've made a mistake .
Hey , can we please get back to work ?
Fine . Then we'll just stay here and do it .
We were up to you .
It wasn't , it was not , you are a nutcase .
Yes , you can .
What about me ?
Alright , noted . But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz ' they're hitting on your sister .
Oh , a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend's couch . Yippee .
That actually does help .
Amazon offers one-day rush .
Stuart .
Get out .
So , wait , what have you been doing for the past six months ?
It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics . They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates .
What happened ?
Sheldon !
But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor , I might not have that much choice in where I end up .
Why would you buy peppermint schnapps ?
No .
Alright . Here we go . My first birthday party .
No .
No .
They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat . Let's hope the lug nut expands .
Fine , put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag .
Oh , doesn't seem like it . She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her .
Why me ?
Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters , you can focus on the real people who are already in your life .
You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive , but a black lady still answered the space phone ?
Yeah , yeah it's all good . Everything's going to work out . One way or another .
Whoa ! What do you mean all ?
Can I get you anything ?
To live with Penny and not you , you crazy bastard .
Are you sure you want to do this ?
Then what was oh , boy ?
Wow . That's rough .
Well , now you're making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location .
Yes .
Oh , sure . Huh , maybe I am her gay friend .
He's drowning us out . He doesn't like fighting .
I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny , tell her she has nothing to worry about .
If you're that upset , go get her back .
Alicia , what do you want as your default setting for DVDs , 5.1 Dolby or DTS ?
I'll check his room .
You're kidding .
That's right , you saw what you saw . That's how we roll in The Shire .
Let's get ' em !
Morning .
Oh no .
I live here .
Yeah .
Mom .
She said no , can we drop it now ?
All right , now , one benefit of quantum coupling '
Sheldon ? Your mum made dinner .
I don't know what to tell you , but they're on sale .
Hmm . Maybe . Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues .
What happened ? Did you tell him it was my idea ?
But Raj is from India , which means he's no slouch at holding his breath .
This is good . Our idea is really good .
So , here we are . Back in bed together .
How can you not be sure ?
Oh , wow .
Yeah , it's from Changs .
What are you doing ?
You were right .
Sorry , palm's a little sweaty . What's that word ?
Who you bringing ?
Sheldon .
We're really sorry . It was an accident .
Well , roomie , it's only one night a week , but it's a start .
Th-th-th-that's okay . I can infer from context .
What does your agent think ?
Really , so why did you come ?
Funny expression , sleep tight . It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally ' sleep tight .
Oh , there is no winning with you . And koalas and otters don't even live near each other .
Oh , if anything , I'm trying to get my Sheld-off .
When do we leave ?
Hey , you can make jokes , but if this keeps up , he's gonna move back in here .
Yeah , it's a perfectly good word . You put it in front of wine or dining , and you've really got something . Okay , well , let me ask you this , how was last night for you ?
Sheldon , why are you sitting by yourself ?
Leonard and Penny , I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused . I went to stay at Howard's . PS Cinnamon's with me , but if you feel like messing with Sheldon , tell him she's loose in the building .
Yes , but , only to clean .
Maybe you can .
Well , how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees ?
You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard .
I promise .
No , she had dental insurance .
Hey . Oh , how'd the audition go ?
Sit down , we want to talk to you .
Apparently so .
Yes .
He wants to talk about Penny . I don't want to talk about Penny .
I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit .
Me , too . So , you ever think about it ?
That someone has a name .
No , no . It's kind of crazy . I've never fooled around in the lab before .
Because I've been busy , because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up , and mostly , and I can't stress how key this is , because I don't want to .
Hey .
I'm so sorry .
You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date .
Um , I'm okay with you driving my car . I'm not okay with you flying my car .
Ooh , and one time when you were asleep , Amy totally took off her ' and that's why you're the best roommate ever .
All right , you brought this on yourself . Sheldon , get him .
Well , one of them is .
She's not Catwoman , she's just a generic cat .
I might kill him right now .
Sorry , let me help you .
You're right , you should go .
I'll give you a hint . We're watching Daredevil .
Aaargh . What the hell ?
Three .
No , I think it's because we're eloping .
Well , you're welcome .
Two can play this game . Penny '
Yeah , come on , Howard . Hook that worm .
Damn it .
Hi . Well , uh , oh , welcome to the building .
How is that a new invention ?
Look , if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me .
Yeah , we're really close . Uh , uh , we're at the apartment .
Gee , why wouldn't I ?
You want some Oreos ?
Oh , thanks , man .
All ? In particle physics , twenty five is Woodstock .
C'mon now , throw one .
So , we'll just order three entrees .
Do you have a cousin Leopold .
Sheldon , don't ruin the game .
You cannot possibly be that arrogant .
Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box , Sheldon .
No , it's all over .
Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight ?
No , I got you something for Valentine's Day , and I was too embarrassed to give it to you .
And we live here , so we have no choice .
All right , problem solved .
Good night .
What are you doing here ?
Fine , I told Sheldon that her apartment's been finished , but then you just said it's not , so now I'm all confused .
Well , you clearly did something to aggravate her .
Yeah .
What do you think ?
Hi , uh , um , I'm Leonard ?
We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life .
Since when don't you knock ? It's like the only good thing about you .
Well , then what do you want us to do ?
Penny , Penny , listen , I hope you're not doing this ' cause of you and me , because I have a girlfriend , and you're a single woman .
No .
Sheldon , just buy scalped tickets with us .
Uh , uh , uh , yes , I did .
What does that mean , under your bed ?
Um , if you don't have any other plans , do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon ?
This weekend .
Hey . Penny , don't get upset . Here . I love you , but , no , I will not marry you .
Still , I'd like to know the details . His mother was human , his father was Vulcan , they couldn't just conceive .
I say , this one time , instead of wimping out , let's be badasses .
Excuse me , Amy . Penny , do you have plans for dinner tonight ?
Hey , I said I was sorry . What else do you want from me ?
Did you try calling her on the telephone ?
Hey , buddy . Good to hear your voice .
Yes .
Okay , how about this ? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over .
Yeah , me , too .
Oh , I'm sorry .
The Newcomb medal .
Nope , it was better before .
Now , now , you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer . That's all anyone could ask .
So , Stuart , have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house ?
Yeah , yeah , now that's you , obnoxious and insufferable .
You bought my mom's book ?
John and Yoko .
Sure , that's another way to go .
Preach .
I don't know . Scree-scree .
No . But compared to your boss , he's the poster boy for sanity .
Sheldon , I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny .
I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things . I'll pick you up when you're done .
Hey , Olsen twins '
You , uh , moving into the apartment on the fifth floor ?
Tina ?
Do you want liquid helium or not ?
How'd it go with my mother ?
Why would I want to do that ?
No . You need to give me some advice .
That's your system ?
Oh , you're his little girl , he can't stay mad at you .
This is ridiculous . Are we gonna play cards or not ?
For what ?
Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back .
Comic book store .
Well , it's tricky working with superfluids . Whatever container you put them in , they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own .
That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy . Oh , my God . You ran over a hobo .
Oh , would you stop worrying about that ?
It's nothing fancy , but it'll get you to auditions , and at least for now , you don't have to go back to waitressing .
Can we please change the subject .
Did it ?
I thought the movie was about 18th - century Vienna ?
Damn straight , almost 1am . And we weren't even watching TV . We were watching Netflix , like the kids do .
Mm , you watched The Bachelor a lot .
Oh , I like to laugh . But say it anyway .
So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week ?
Congratulations Howard .
Are you kidding ? I couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his freakin ' napkins .
She introduced me to her father , kissed me and then shut the door in my face .
Yeah .
Yeah .
nard : Uh , yeah , experimental physics .
Sheldon , Kripke's not smarter than you . You just got stuck on a wrong path . Happened to Einstein . He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades .
Yeah .
Forget about the cake , how did you know that my birthday is Saturday ?
I kind of like the sound of that .
I know , but when I shop online , I can do it on the toilet .
Ooh , Emily . I heard him say that to Emily . Hey , I thought you were staying home .
I hate all of you and myself . Three .
Really ?
No , it's no big deal , it's just the way I was raised . My parents focussed on celebrating achievements , and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them .
No , if a man dresses as a bat , that's Batman , but if Man-Man dresses as a bat , that's Batman-Man .
Yes . And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party , you didn't have to stay .
No , but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't .
Oh , you're good at this .
Well , since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me ?
Mm-hmm . Well , I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of '
It's just a theory . Uh , it's not even worked out .
I can't believe you're married to that idiot .
My point is , while you're spending all this time on your own , building computers or practicing your cello , what you're really doing is becoming interesting . And when people finally do notice you , they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought . And for those of you who were popular in high school , it's over , sorry . Thank you and congratulations .
Go , go , go , go !
A little , but he's basically harmless . He's actually kind of a nice guy .
Oh ' uh ' no ' we don't live together ' um ' we live together but in separate , heterosexual bedrooms .
Come on . Sorry to bother you .
And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat .
Oh , could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom ? I take a lot of medicine .
No , don't make it so . Barry , we can't fight you tomorrow , our engineer is incapacitated .
Hey , we're here .
Look , Penny , we'd love to help you , but Raj is going through some stuff right now . And besides , he doesn't drink , so '
Raj ?
Yeah , but I don't see a better one on the horizon , so '
They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that , don't they ? All right . Look , just remember how this works . We don't get mad about these things . Uh , speaking of which , I've addressed your bug report on my date planning . Got a really fun evening for you . It's kind of a surprise .
If it helps you sleep , then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman ?
Really ?
I look forward to it .
Hey , how'd it go ?
So , Mom , you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged .
Hi .
Sheldon , why is this letter in the trash ?
This isn't so bad .
Okay , now I have to ask . What do they do ?
Okay . I don't get it , you said make an effort , here I am making an effort .
No , but I was awake all night .
With Penny and me , it took two years . Now that I think about it , that was three dates .
Hey , we brought you Thai . Where is everything ?
Well , why ? What's wrong ?
Okay , so Kripke played a joke on you .
Yeah .
Alright , um , just , uh , let me get my keys .
You know what ? I am tired of living in fear of this guy . I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school . You know , pick on someone your own size , you did not have sex with my mother , and yes , I do know why I'm hitting myself . '
Yeah , Stephanie got it for me . It's kind of fun .
We should let you guys talk .
Yeah . It's wonderful . Okay , maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly , but it's fine , it's great .
You never stop talking , do you ?
Mmm , when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation .
He'll figure it out when he falls off the roof .
No .
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh .
Penny , you are on fire .
Hey .
Right . Sorry .
Sheldon , Penny was our only hope .
Making great time . Gonna be there pretty early .
Okay , fine , what do you suggest ?
In retrospect , that was clue number two .
Okay , there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow . Sheldon , what do you do ?
Yes .
Yeah , good for you .
Oh cool , I'll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan .
Yes .
I don't know what he's putting on those cards , but you are smarter than ever .
No , no , she's too proud to ask for the money . I , on the other hand , feel you should honour your debt .
What ? Who would tell you something like that ? Why would you tell her something like that ?
Penny , wait . Aagh ! What is wrong with you ?
I know .
You kept walking . I think you did .
Probably .
Does it bother you ?
What's going on ?
I know . I just thought as an outsider , you might be able to provide a fresh perspective .
And while you're at it , I know that at this age your hormones are raging , but just because all your friends are having sex doesn't mean you have to .
Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister .
That's a lot less big .
I don't think he had a family .
I wonder if that's why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon . I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby , but the baby had Sheldon's head on it .
I know , I , I , I crossed a line . And I'm sorry . No , no , no , hang on . I really mean it . And it's not like when we were going out , I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed . This is a 100 % sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry .
You know what ? I don't have to stand here and take this crap .
Watch , watch out , watch out for pedestrians !
Sheldon , you are really being unreasonable .
Uh , she's your friend . Step up .
Uh , don't lower yourself to their level .
I wonder where Dr . Lorvis is . He's been gone a while .
Hey , where you been ?
Penny , you've got cheetos in your hair .
Look , I know he can be aggravating , but what you have to remember is that he's not doing it on purpose . It's just how he is . But he's also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together .
Right . Lesley , I would like to propose an experiment .
Why are you learning Chinese ?
He's afraid the original owners will come back .
It's good that we got out and did something physical .
Okay , well , this time it's going to be different . Because I am like a romance ninja . You don't see it coming , and then bam , romance , watch out , hearts , kisses , love , ooh-ya !
Wait , are we really going to Long Beach ?
Hey .
I'm just saying , it felt like it may have meant something .
Where's Batman ?
I'll see what I can do .
And she likes you .
This is great . It , thank you , it's , so much .
Very hard .
How are we going to get it upstairs ?
Bring a ball or a Frisbee , you know , something he can chase .
What's going on ?
Just give us a minute .
Yeah . And I'm a little worried because things between us have been so great , and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up .
Hey , pretty lady .
The box says kitchen .
I'm helping .
I get it . Smallville almost wrecked you .
Yeah .
I said I'm her friend . Not her gay friend .
Oh , well , that kind of stinks .
Um , it did end happy for you . You're here with me .
It's not a bidding war , I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store .
Yeah , we did our own search .
Yeah , definitely better before .
Well , I can't read your mind , Penny !
I'm sure I'm overreacting .
Ooh , flowers and chocolates ? Somebody's trying to get me out of my panties .
Calm down , Sheldon .
That's right , say my name , and beg me for more , ' cause , I'm gonna give it to you .
He didn't meant that .
Raj , you're up .
A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings . Now he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size . Now watch this .
I think we're fine , Stuart .
Because ' . uh , Friday , we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium .
Save it for your blog , Howard .
We tried . She doesn't get along with Sheldon .
So it's nothing I did ? It's her problem ?
Here you go .
Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration . Uh , new salon topic . What's more important , an idea or its execution ?
Sold . ' I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place . ' There . It's done .
I'd like to refer that to my attorney .
What ?
And you're going to stay calm ?
Yeah . Well , we work at the same place as you , and we've always been fine .
Come on , Dennis , I'll show you the radiation lab .
That was three weeks ago .
Don't you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date ?
Yeah , sure . He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency ?
I don't think I can go to the North Pole .
I can't believe you've never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark .
What ? Hey , hey ! Come back here !
It was the heat of the moment .
I didn't make it back . The ship sank , I'm in hell .
Fine , then you go .
What did you spill on it ?
It's take your daughter to work day .
Sorry about that .
Any chance you know what it is ?
Just like you .
Nope . Uh , uh , I might not know what I meant , but I know that I didn't mean that . Not this guy . Oh , no way .
Okay , he must be in his bedroom . My spare glasses are in my bedroom , on my dresser , next to my Bat-signal .
What was it doing on the ceiling ?
Why ?
I don't know who you talked to , but that wasn't my mother .
When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say , ooh , check out this Blu-ray player , it must be good , it was built in Russia ' ?
Hey , do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you'd ever had ?
Sheldon , I've got some bad news .
Hmm .
It sounds like either way , I finally get some rest .
What ?
Isn't it kind of nice ? I mean , he was with the wrong person , and now he found the right person .
Coffee maker ?
Why not ? People do things right now all the time . Why can't we be right now people too . Go home , pack a bag and we'll be right now people . I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription , but after that we'll go right now .
You know what ? I've gone 12 times . Maybe I'll sit out this year , too .
No .
Okay , bye . My mother's coming to visit .
Sure , Dad .
Because I didn't want to sound like a jerk .
You're kidding , well , then , that's something we have in common .
Yes .
We had a full spool yesterday .
Oh , right . That .
I'll start again .
His girlfriend .
About what ?
You told her my experiment was stupid ?
Unless , Superman matches her speed and decelerates .
Just Bilbo Baggins ' sword over there .
I wasn't staring !
Or we could be omegas . They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas .
Whatever . You can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement .
I'm serious . I'll do it .
I do .
No .
Yes . He , he's late because he's on his way here from 1940 .
Is that , oh , my , I didn't see the ring with my glasses off , so , look at that , I'm starting to exude .
Just explaining the theory of relativity . Twice .
It's dark out and he's alone , I don't like it . Let's go get him .
It just makes things seem small . It diminishes them .
Calm down . We'll figure it out .
Okay , that's enough , Howard . The poor guy's had a tough time . He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit .
Got it .
No , that's actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space .
Sorry , but we can't sign this .
The Harmony One was fine . We didn't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred , which he knows is too big for my hand .
Mmm , in a way . We presented papers , and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other .
Yeah , sure , that might be fun .
It's late . We've wasted hours . Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight ?
You want to breed a new friend ?
Yeah , good for you .
Uh , if you don't mind , Mrs . Cooper , there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles , and you have no idea how much I want to be on it .
Hey , what's up ?
So , menus .
What's this do , spin ?
What's that ?
I've gotten a lot better at that , you know . I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies .
That's because you've never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day .
Yes .
No , that's Marcie . Peppermint Patty's just athletic .
Me , too .
Yeah . Right . Sure . The thing is , before you guys went out , I spoke to him and '
What about
Well , Sheldon , it took me all morning , but I found the owner of the video store . And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep , drunk at the bottom of a pool . Anyway , there is no one to return the DVD to , so this issue is resolved . Ah ! And I'd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable , I didn't use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me .
Good morning .
Why should I let it go ? Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep ?
No reason . I was just talking to Raj , and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days .
I think we have to acknowledge , those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews .
Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease .
Hey , we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab .
Come on , it's Christmas , just give me this one .
Not bad . I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would .
There's gotta be something else we could try .
Are you sure ? Because you always say no , and then you eat half my fries .
There's a principle at stake .
Look at that . To my friend , Leonard , from Stan Lee , Excelsior !
Call someone .
I'm afraid so . You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights ?
It only gets funnier when you explain it , Sheldon .
Well , it's not really a great time . Penny and I have some things we need to talk about .
Yeah , I'm going to need a little more .
Hey , Stuart , what's going on ?
Yeah .
Wait , wait , wait . You had surgery ?
Maybe we should give them some privacy .
Congratulations .
Look , you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this .
No , it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad .
No , I do , and that's why I hid it .
Yeah . Yeah , I guess I am .
I know . I was hoping to go without anyone finding out .
Terrible . I worked really hard on that project . I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout .
I don't understand why we're leaving so early for the movie .
Aw . What's wrong with her ?
So Penny's a little messy .
Since when do you hum songs ?
Amy , this is for you .
Maybe , but I'm guessing it will cost you about $ 500 an hour to try .
I want to invoke the girlfriend pact , Howard .
Great .
Well , then , what do you want ?
My God , who's the dork now ? Thank you for wearing your flats .
nard : I like it .
Oh , no , no , you have it wrong . No . I , I was going to be a jackass , but I stopped myself . I stayed a good guy , so , I'm gonna pass on the sex . But you should know , that's not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness . That's kind of my superpower . I'm , like , Captain Good Guy .
Sheldon , you have to let somebody else answer .
And we lived happily ever after .
Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed ?
So , I can't go .
See , this right here , what you're doing , can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom ?
You let a guy sit on me .
Hey , you guys want to go on a real live quest ?
Why are you taking his side ?
Yeah . Okay , listen . If you're imagining that it was sexy , it wasn't . We , we were both drunk , and she smelled like an ashtray . The boat was moving a lot , so I chipped her tooth .
What I'm trying to say is that , maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise .
To my bones . I mean , I'm not gonna do anything about it . I love Penny . It's just nice to have a young , attractive woman sniffing around the goods .
That's my best friend .
Really ? You figured out the graphene problem ?
All righty then . Guess I'll just get started .
Something terrible in a former life ? I don't know .
Really ? Great !
Hey .
Sheldon , you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny .
So , Polly , tell me about yourself .
No , if it's not a fact , it's not a fact .
So , what did you think of your first funeral ?
I'm sorry about the journal . I want to make it up to you . So I'm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook .
Okay .
Thanks for the heads up .
Wow . When does that start ?
Am I allowed to ask how the class is going ?
Hey , guys , can I just say something ? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now ? This is literally the top of the world . Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see .
If you get him a job , he's gonna live here forever !
Whoa .
Sheldon , we still have 380 of these things to make .
Hmm . Lisa's gonna be disappointed .
Okay . Hey , Howard , any thoughts on where we should get dinner ?
Want me to make you some tea ?
Third floor , wrong apartment .
I know what he looks like .
What ?
What the hell is eighth base ?
Oh , come on , I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore .
Okay , I got it , I got it , she's not your girlfriend . Now listen to me . I know about loneliness . I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff . When I broke up with Penny , I got back into my cello , I built a bunch of model rockets , I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell .
Do you have any ideas ?
Star Trek . You know , the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire .
Oh , hi .
nard : Yes .
Sure . In my mind , that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex .
I don't know . What's the difference ?
Well , she's not really into that kind of stuff .
He just made that easier .
Uh , yes .
Yeah . You , too . Uh , Jimmy , this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard .
So I'm like a bran muffin .
Seriously ?
What are you doing ?
It is a little big for the living room , isn't it ?
Okay , when you say seeing Penny , what exactly does that mean ?
Hey , Penny . We're kind of in the middle of a crisis , here .
Give me that .
I don't think I can go out with her tonight .
Why did you need a belt ?
She might disappear , but she's definitely not cleaning anything .
They might be smarter than some people .
Oh , well , you know , you did throw an 8 gig iPod ' yeah , no , how could he do that .
Hey , how'd it go ?
Have you ever seen them ?
No , that was a different , different guy .
Oh-oh .
There there .
And then nothing . I stopped it . But it still bothers me , and I wanted you to know .
You're welcome . I just wanted to put that out there .
Uh-huh .
Uh , six .
Yes , and you've never met one of them .
So , um , I've been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat .
What ?
Yes .
57 , 58 , 59 , that's one minute .
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it .
Here's Spock's head with no body . Here's Mr . T's body with no head . Oh , yeah , here's Spock's body with Mr . T's head . I pity the fool who's illogical .
Yes . Thank you .
Oh , right , yeah , um , so , Stephanie , here's the thing . I really like you .
Don't even ! I don't want to hear another word out of you .
Saloons ?
Morning .
I don't want to play a game , Sheldon .
No . Maybe to her .
That doesn't make it true .
And you think my presence will help with that ?
It's not just that . My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him .
I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q . If that's not a time to bust out the scrabble dance , what's the point of having one ? Hey , Barry Kripke started a fencing club .
Come on , you pain in the ass .
Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain .
Why ?
Sheldon , you're talking like a crazy person .
Sheldon , relax .
I'm in .
Hello .
I asked .
He doesn't ; he just likes looking at them . Bring a book .
It's indoors , so no sunscreen .
Don't want people to see what , huh ? A little bit of this ?
Yep .
You still are . Uh , Mom , hey , tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner .
Eh , that just means going barefoot .
Well , if that was a movie I would go see it .
Oh , right , right right right right .
Well , trust me , I wish it never happened .
Really ? This is going to decide who's the hero and who's the sidekick ?
Is that it ?
Great , great . Did you walk the whole way ? It's a little chilly .
Holy crap , are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ?
I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food .
I don't know .
Uh-huh . Well , the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really
I know .
You have any ideas , Raj ?
Um , whew ? Is this about the test , or is this about us ?
I'm in love . Let's do something else .
I met this girl , and she's great . We have a lot in common .
It's just for my notebooks . Thanks , Penny .
No . But it was okay . I mean , when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind , and surprise me with a party , like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson , and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front , and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering , and I could smell German chocolate cake , which is my favourite .
Oh , yeah ? Mummies are wrapped in bandages .
Look , do you want to buy me out or not ?
I don't know , it's still a little weird since , you know '
What do you mean ?
So , how do you wanna do this ?
Hey , what took you guys so long ?
Sheldon's nervous about me leaving . Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone .
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra ?
What's the emergency ?
Mm , butt print . There's no discernible butt print .
Nope . Maybe another time .
Sheldon '
Yeah .
Thank you . Seriously , please don't make me go .
Okay , well , I'll take you .
I know .
Yeah , time's gonna fly by .
It's not hard . Just picture the Three Stooges , and then take away two stooges .
Oh , like Halley's comet .
Are you crazy ? You don't know who this person is . Delete that .
Come on , you know how it is with break-ups .
Okay , I found the , uh , court papers that you and Zack need to fill out . I'll print them when we get home .
What's the matter ?
Hey .
No doubt , no doubt . Okay , well , I'm sorry it didn't work out .
Coming . Hey , lovebug .
See ?
Are you kidding me ? I already have two strikes .
What ? Why ?
People could call me Angie . Yo , Angie , how's it goin ' ?
Terrific .
Yeah , that's a real pickle . Bye .
Sheldon , this is crazy .
Really , what changed ?
Wuh , Penny .
It might've been the worst one we've ever had .
Sheldon , it's , wait , I can go home without you ? Bye .
All right , you two , don't start . Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit . Can you please not ruin it ?
They weren't boobies , they were muscles . And the make-up was green . I was pretending to be The Hulk .
Moo-stache .
That is so great . Oh , I'm Leonard , I live downstairs . Upstairs from here , but under you . Not under you per se , but under your apartment .
Of course , they did . That's what grandmothers do .
Well , I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants , I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'll be throwing my hat in the ring .
All right , let me start again . Uh , you and Amy '
Uh , yeah . Sure , I guess .
Fine . You walk up to the house , knock on the door and demand your stuff back . What if he says no ?
Infinite Sheldon ?
Really ?
Sheldon , you need to work in the morning .
You went with Thor ?
Sounds like a breakthrough , should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover ?
This is ridiculous . Dammit , Sheldon , snap out of it . You're a physicist , you belong at the University doing research , not hiding in your room .
Of course . Well , hey , how about this ? Whether we're friends , not friends , scattered around the world , no matter what , let's all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8: 00 p . m . and have dinner like we always do .
Okay , that's enough .
No , we're not , we're not , not a couple , two singles , like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that ' . are friends .
Great . What are you going to do first ?
Let's go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve .
Okay , since we agree on the delivery system for the message , maybe we should talk about what the message could be .
Oh , God .
No kidding .
Uh , listen , I heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a pre-nup .
Hey , you're in a good mood .
Hold on . We always do this .
Yeah . I'm excited to help .
So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back .
I don't know
If I need a break , I'll ask for a break .
But if you're ever short , there's always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern's ass .
All right , fine . So you want to get back together with her , but you're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did .
Are you sure ? That doesn't sound right .
Huh ?
Okay , that's it , you're fired .
And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system .
Nothing , just rethinking my whole life . Okay , here's the thing , I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out , she'll just dump me .
But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat ?
Morning .
I was thinking we could work on this at night , and then maybe in a couple of weeks , we'll have ourselves an app to sell .
See , Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am .
I wish Penny didn't have to work , she loves camping .
Okay , so I , I , I guess I'll just jump right in .
I , I think I still have it .
Can we please just go in , my chain mail is stuck in my underwear .
Yeah , well , I'm just glad to be a part of it . So what happens now ?
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow .
Oh , what the hell .
Hey , I am every bit as much of a man as Penny . Now , let's do this .
Good night .
I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing .
Kill me .
If you want to drive , just drive . I don't see why this has to be so complicated .
Look , even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time .
Ladies ?
That's nice . What about ?
Yeah , perfect .
I don't know , now they're just yelling about Popsicles . Sounds like Penny really got to him .
I'm not leaving until you talk to me .
Same as when we lost you at the zoo .
It is pretty spicy .
They're not going anywhere .
What is ? No , not like that ! Just , Leonard went to the office .
Yeah , it's delicious , the sarcasm's a little stale , though . Hey , how about this ? Until we figure out what to do with the ring , Penny holds on to it .
I'm sorry , Dr . Jeffries , I'm just excited . This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is , it's really interesting .
Hey , Howard , I need to tell you something .
That's actually good . Why didn't I think of that ?
That is a tough one . Uh , I know he brushes both of them .
I know . And it's not like we're abandoning him . Plus , we can FaceTime him whenever we want , you know , once iPhones are invented in his universe .
What , who told you that ?
I know this isn't my area , and I could never do the math like you can , but could this be something ?
Of course she did . Anyway , that's not what I was gonna say . When I was ten years old , I built a hugging machine .
W-wait !
You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol .
I was just going off your comment about the nice guy '
How's that been working for you ?
Well , what are you thinking of naming it ?
As is the company .
Absolutely . You're the girl , I'm the guy . Now , you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here .
Sheldon , we have to get out of here .
No , I heard that .
Yeah .
Okay , we've got power to the laser .
When were you going to tell me about this ?
What are you doing ?
That's true .
Hang on . They're showing a new digital print of Time Bandits , you wouldn't want to come , would you ?
You were trying to blow up my head .
Night . Attaboy , Hofstadter . Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies . Hey , I'm back .
For God's sakes . Sheldon , come here !
Sheldon , I know what you did , now change the password back .
You okay ?
Sheldon , Sheldon ?
Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore ?
I have two words for you . The first is big , the other's whoop .
Wait a minute , so the eye patch and the insults worked ?
Howard's at the Mars Rover lab . He says he's in trouble . Defcon 5 .
Sorry . How did it go ?
And I'm gonna hit the head . That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee .
What the hell are bus pants ?
Oh , my God , it's seven .
Mm , just down there .
What ? Then . then why don't you do it ?
What is going on ?
Uh , at least they're talking about the theory . I mean , that's what's important .
Hi .
Maybe your tongue is shrinking .
Hey . We're , uh , going to the movies .
You know , a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us .
Hey , how was your ' what ?
You had some nice moves out there , Howard .
Will you knock it off ? We're across the hall .
Here we are .
It would be a replica of a movie prop .
Gonna be a long night .
More Halloween candy ? Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday ?
No .
I'm going to work . You can come if you want .
Are we overthinking this ?
I know . Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where's Wolowitz ? Okay , now , This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel .
Yeah , sure .
Batman . Batman and Robin . Uh , Wonder Twins plus the monkey . Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman .
Yeah , but we'll be old and gross together .
Like what ?
Can I sleep on your couch tonight ?
I know what the anthropic principle is .
I guess I'll see you .
Oh , I'll make a motion , but you're not going to like it .
Sheldon , you are not sick . This is , but you are not .
Why are you doing this ?
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey . Mrs . Davis .
Hey , what's going on with you ?
There's no junk jiggling . We just talk .
Alright , oh wait , they use it to in '
And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything's cool .
Why is there a hole here ?
You know , maybe you and I wouldn't be together , but you wouldn't have done so great yourself .
Sorry , Officer .
Listen , don't worry . I'll talk to him .
Not good ?
The , the gas station across the street .
It's not a date , and that's racist .
No one's getting tortured .
You're right . I didn't ask her out , I should ask her out .
Yes .
Yeah . I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of ' em .
Ah , ah .
Well , not really .
What about ' damsel in distress ? '
You miss the blanket now , don't you ?
Okay , yeah , um , do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding ?
What's going on ?
Heartrate , pheromones , etc , yes .
Uh , uh , uh , hang on . Do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful ?
Gals ? Who are you , Fred Flintstone ?
Sheldon , I , I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings . I've been holding a lot of this in for a while .
Or as you probably call it back home , food .
Forget the robot . What happened to you ?
I get it . Uh , just this morning , Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict .
On the bright side , I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers .
Fine . But can't we go home and start this ?
I thought you said candles were dangerous .
What about my robot poster ?
I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie . You're a young man .
Excuse me . Is there anything you'd like to apologise for ?
Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement , not mine ?
Well , yeah .
Well '
That is not a compromise . A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how .
I'm sorry , what did I say ?
Yeah . Why ?
Because your friend was rude to her , and then you went to dinner with him .
If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife , you might want to watch your waistline .
I didn't do it for the money !
You're right . But what ? Mexican ? Italian ? German ? Indian ? Greek ? Cuban ? Chinese ? Pizza ? Barbecue ? Korean ? Korean barbecue ?
Mmm , in my family , holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society .
Yeah .
I don't care . I don't have anything to hide .
Thank you Sheldon , you're a good friend .
All right .
I'm missing something . ( Enters apartment . To Sheldon ) Did you say something to Penny about Alex ?
You're not dying . It's just the flu .
Sure .
No , I mean since the Shamy hit a reef .
What's the last thing you were ever happy about ?
But , you forget , I did ask you out in real life .
He's right . You can't .
Come on , guys , push .
Actually , ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid .
Now that Penny and I are engaged , I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements .
That is not fair . I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month .
Yeah , she does .
All right , well , off the top of my head , I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow . I mean , glacial .
Look , you can trust us . We're respected scientists .
Yeah ? So ?
O-o-o-o-h ! Again ?
So are our laptops .
From her micro-husband . That is amazing . How long did this take you ?
Sheldon , don't make that noise , it's disrespectful .
We should go easy on him . Amy's out with Stuart tonight .
Oh , great .
So , was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment ?
It was . By Terminator .
Beats me . They were playing all last night too .
Hope you're hungry .
Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen ?
What ?
Sheldon '
Yup , oh , here you go .
Why won't you sign it ?
That's because we are .
Sheldon , can I talk to you in private ?
Yup . I told him if he didn't bite the hygienist , I'd take him for ice cream .
Hey , you okay ?
Uh-huh , I'm normally very nice , but you shut up , too .
Why say it ?
Really ? Sex last night , pancakes this morning , am I dying ?
Well , what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves ?
I got it , I got it . Listen , um , I think there's been a misunderstanding . See , Penny is my fianc'e .
Alright , please don't cheer me up anymore .
What for ? It's not going to rain .
Well , you're about to be in an even better one . I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure , but , I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it . Your element does not exist .
Go away .
Uh , sure . Why ?
Hey . Hi .
And that's still good for you .
What is it ?
I could use the bathroom at 8: 20 .
You can't kill him , he'll just respawn at the last save point .
It's a Saturnalia miracle .
Why does it have to get weird ?
I think if you're pulling up your pants , you're not a doorman .
nard : A bad thing . A very bad thing . Get the door . Get the door ! Get the door ! Get the door ! Get the door !
No , seriously , I think I've finally figured out my problem with women .
No , I didn't realize it had been so long . Sure , I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it .
Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live .
Yeah . Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season .
Next we need a teaspoon of pepper , which , I believe , was also the name of your childhood dog .
Good for you , on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child .
We're here to see Koothrappali , not kill Batman .
Absolutely not . If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling , then Leonard gots to get paid . So , you think about us getting married ?
Oh , I'll get it . Go sports .
Well , if it makes you feel any better , I screwed things up pretty good with Penny .
Great .
Oh , sure . Wait , Nancy ?
Hello ? What is this ?
Stay out of this . You and your stupid machine started this fight .
Okay , well , right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level , but I really don't need any help .
Aw , see , yeah , you probably shouldn't have done that . So write another e-mail , set the record straight , it's no big deal .
That long , huh ?
Sheldon , I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment .
Sheldon , we've been through this . I'm taking Penny .
You have a will ?
May what ?
No , I'm not shy .
What ? Oh , okay , uh , okay , yeah , no problem , just come up here and help me pull and turn .
Uh , t-minus five hours , 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower .
Well , uh , okay , um , I don't want to get back together with Penny . We tried it , it was crazy , it didn't work , but I can't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj . And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya , who I've been going out with for eight months , is moving back to India . So I'm just completely confused and alone .
You know , on some level , I've always believed that I don't deserve a woman like her .
What ? Here ? Now ?
It's the social protocol , it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at .
Oh , right , sure . I wish you could stay in LA a while longer .
Pass the soy sauce .
See , the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet , and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson , but that future no longer exists , due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2 .
Hey , Sheldon , let's go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine , you love that .
Look , in our defence , it was kind of a spur of the moment thing , and also , we don't like her .
What ?
That might work too .
Hey , buddy . How you doing ?
Oh , that is not true .
Yes , you do .
Yeah , that too . Everything's broken .
Okay , it's on .
Hi !
I drive you to work every day , my brain must look like the Hulk .
Just say , Leonard went to the office .
So how's work ?
You have fun . I will not be attending .
Stan Lee .
Look , I mean , I'm not proud of it , but it does work . I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python . Even I was bored , I just wanted to see if she'd make it to the end .
Well , yeah , Stuart thrives under pressure , that's why he works in a comic book store .
Hey , Leslie .
See ? Ruined .
That is a lot of cologne .
If you ever need a break , the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee .
Really ?
It says right here on Wikipedia . A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties .
Really ?
Before I answer , may I just say your skin has never looked better .
Oh , come on , he's just going to play with it twice , and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk .
This is just half ? We've been here for hours .
I hadn't '
Will you shut up ?
Really ? Triumphant ?
Look , it's you .
The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch .
Uh , uh , does it at least pay well ?
Huh . What is this ?
Okay , um , well , there was this girl .
Did ' okay , maybe ' some of it , but , look , the guy was just in the right place , at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe . He got lucky .
We didn't have to , that was clearly a tangent . Now come on . Back to work . If we're leaning towards quantum coupling ' Aah ! Why ?
I don't like trains . You like trains .
Uh , yeah , uh , right here .
Uh , I'm just gonna tell you the truth .
Well , it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time . Although , truth be told , my groin's a little worse for wear .
What about it ?
Sheldon , do you really expect to enforce this ?

On the other hand , some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works , it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it .
There's no way we can get to the ridge . The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off .
Elizabeth ? What's going on ?
I don't think so .
If you don't do this , I won't take you to the comic book store .
What is wrong with you ?
Uh , I do , I have to work . But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father , ' cause , you know , just the kind of boyfriend I am .
And that didn't bother you ?
You do what you want , I'm not touching another man's honey tree .
I thought we were getting breakfast before work .
Did your sister say anything when you got home last night ?
Actually , they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion . Without him , they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place .
I know . It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him .
I highly doubt that . Go away .
No , but you can have mine .
Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom ?
You can't be serious . ' Cause I messed up and made out with a girl , you're gonna do the same with a random guy ?
Okay .
Why the hell not ?
If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she , Penny , thought that I should her , Lesley , out , indicating that she , Penny , had no interest in me asking her , Penny , out . But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she , Lesley , had turned me down then she , Penny , could be offering consolation . That's too bad , you would have made a cute couple . But while thinking , good , Leonard remains available .
I'm not saying it was bad , I'm just saying it ' wasn't great .
There's this guy , Jimmy Speckerman , who used to torment me in high school . He sent me a message through Facebook . He's in town and wants to have drinks .
Well '
Thank you .
Yeah .
Yeah , I wanted to explain .
Sheldon , hang tight . Hey , do you want me to bring anything ?
Mm , I don't know . I get a lawyer , he gets a lawyer , it's just easier to stand behind the tape .
Fine .
I don't know what to say .
Hey .
Next level .
Thanks . Hey , do you want to , I don't know , later '
I hadn't really given it much thought .
I wouldn't be bored . Why would I be bored ?
Here's an idea . I'm just throwing it out there , friends who have sex .
Well , then , I'm putting sex back on the table . What do you think about that ?
That's incredible .
So you're actually okay with invading your friend's privacy ?
It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster . Maybe there's something there , maybe there isn't . We'll probably never know . But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it .
I'm not gonna schmooze anybody . I'm gonna let my work speak for itself .
Oh , this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies ' man .
Oh , the video game . Yeah , that was bad .
Hey , Sheldon's not here , so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear .
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial ?
Glaringly obvious . Go on .
None , why ?
: Can we please stop saying coitus ?
Lesley I would like to propose an experiment .
Well , we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner .
Yeah , that scares me , too .
Oh , yes , you do . You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E . T . relationship with him .
I got to tell you , I'm a little worried about him .
Don't tell Koothrappali . After you .
He's not saying it's a magic ring . You're not , are you ?
Who are you calling ?
Well , hey , we're grown-ups . We can still be friends .
Why ? I mean , okay .
I noticed you never answered me .
Hey , ready for lunch ?
Now .
Not unless she destroys Tokyo .
At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend .
Booting .
Okay , he's in the bathroom , let's go .
No I didn't .
Just hang on .
I did . It was right here . She must've ' Oh , my God , we're living together .
Howard , come on , I didn't plan on this . These things just happen . Usually not to me , but they do happen .
I had to , she called me cutie .
Hey , how were things on the set ?
Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun ?
Are you sure ?
Right . Sorry , sorry .
Oh , I don't know . Who cares ? Look at me .
Well answer it . I want to hear .
What ?
I don't know . The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List is tough to beat .
