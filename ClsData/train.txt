label1 So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits  If it's unobserved it will  however  if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target  it will not have gone through both slits 
label1 There's no point  I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt 
label1 Leonard  I don't think I can do this 
label1 No  We are committing genetic fraud  There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring  think about that  I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers 
label1 I know  and I do yearn for faster downloads  but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm  what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve 
label1 I want to leave 
label1 What's the protocol for leaving ?
label1 Let's try just walking out 
label1 Bye-bye
label1 Are you still mad about the sperm bank ?
label1 If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres  most people will trip 
label1 No  it's true  I did a series of experiments when I was twelve  my father broke his clavicle 
label1 No  that was the result of my work with lasers 
label1 Evidently 
label1 Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition  yes she is 
label1 No  We're going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica 
label1 Not with commentary 
label1 We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over 
label1 That's the beauty of it 
label1 To what end ?
label1 Leonard  I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation  you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements 
label1 Well  today we tried masturbating for money 
label1 Actually that's my work 
label1 Yeah  well  it's just some quantum mechanics  with a little string theory doodling around the edges  That part there  that's just a joke  it's a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation 
label1 If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT  sure 
label1 Oh  come on  Who hasn't seen this differential below ' here I sit broken hearted ? '
label1 In all of them  that is the point 
label1 No  I sit there 
label1 What's the difference ?
label1 That's not true  Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time 
label1 Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning 
label1 I resent you saying we don't have company 
label1 Yes  it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality 
label1 You're lactose intolerant 
label1 It took you four years to get through High School ?
label1 You ? No  you'll only make it worse 
label1 Well this is an interesting development 
label1 It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment 
label1 So  what exactly are you trying to accomplish here ?
label1 That woman in there's not going to have sex with you 
label1 Yes  but not of the same species 
label1 Technically that would be coitus interruptus 
label1 I really think we should examine the chain of causality here 
label1 Event A  A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower  Event B  We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend  Query  on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events ?
label1 Ah  yes  well that may be the proximal cause of our journey  but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause 
label1 You think with your penis 
label1 No I don't  And neither do you 
label1 Leonard  the two of us can't even carry a TV 
label1 Okay  thanks for your time 
label1 My apologies  What's your plan 
label1 It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work 
label1 What do you think their combined IQ is ?
label1 Good thinking  I'll just be the muscle 
label1 From the intercom 
label1 Tell him about our IQ 
label1 Leonard 
label1 You're going to have to call her 
label1 It's okay  It wasn't my first pantsing  and it won't be my last 
label1 Well you got me out of my pants 
label1 Don't think like that  you're not going to die alone 
label1 And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize 
label1 That was a valid hypothesis ? What is happening to you ?
label1 Thank you  You're not done with her  are you ?
label1 Not to mention imaginary 
label1 We can't have Thai food  we had Indian for lunch 
label1 They're both curry based cuisines 
label1 They would be gastronomically redundant  I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl 
label1 I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole  but as far as the population of this car goes  you're a veritable Mack Daddy 
label1 Since it's not bee season  you can have my epinephrine 
label1 You don't need chopsticks  this is Thai food 
label1 Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century  Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth  they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth 
label1 You're kidding  right ?
label1 You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy 
label1 In what space  sir  in what space ? She's two feet above the ground  Frankly  if he really loved her  he'd let her hit the pavement  It would be a more merciful death 
label1 I hardly think so 
label1 Well  we don't have a dolly  or lifting belts  or any measurable upper body strength 
label1 Archimedes would be so proud 
label1 Yes  but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring 
label1 Exactly half 
label1 What's your formula for the corner 
label1 Ah  gravity  thou art a heartless bitch 
label1 Yeah  those are men who just had sex 
label1 No we're not  no we're not  no we're not 
label1 Watch your fingers  Watch your fingers  Oh God  my fingers !
label1 No  it hurt
label1 A little messy ? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy  this is chaos  Excuse me  explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid  I'm just inferring that this is a couch  because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale 
label1 Excuse me  but I think we've both found that helpful at times 
label1 Hang on 
label1 This is not anyone's home  this is a swirling vortex of entropy 
label1 Because it was immaculate  I mean  you open that man's closet  it was left to right  evening gowns  cocktail dresses  then his police uniforms 
label1 I helped run some cable for a webcam 
label1 Penny  I just want you to know that  you don't have to live like this  I'm here for you 
label1 I had no choice  I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room  and just outside our living room was that hallway  and immediately adjacent to that hallway was this 
label1 I just gave you a reasonable explanation 
label1 You might want to speak in a lower register 
label1 Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep  so that they'll be roused by a crying baby  If you want to avoid waking her  speak in a lower register 
label1 I am not leaving until I'm done 
label1 If you have time to lean  you have time to clean 
label1 I have to say  I slept splendidly  Granted  not long  but just deeply and well 
label1 Sarcasm ?
label1 Granted  my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox  but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life 
label1 You don't think that crosses a line ?
label1 Do you want some cereal  I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf  Hello  Honey Puffs 
label1 I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet 
label1 Goodbye  Honey Puffs  hello Big Bran 
label1 Really more to organise  you're not actually dirty  per se 
label1 And snoring  And that's probably just a sinus infection  but it could be sleep apnoea  you might want to see an otolaryngologist  It's a throat doctor 
label1 Depending on the depth  that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon 
label1 Penny  Penny  just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave  is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping  or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm 
label1 That wasn't sarcasm ?
label1 Wooh  boy  you are all over the place this morning 
label1 I am truly sorry for what happened last night  I take full responsibility  And I hope that it won't colour your opinion of Leonard  who is not only a wonderful guy  but also  I hear  a gentle and thorough lover 
label1 His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him 
label1 Considering what ? How great this place looks ?
label1 We could put her stereo back there 
label1 Run an infra-red repeater  photocell here  emitter here  easy peasy 
label1 Hang on Penny  How about fans  here and here ?
label1 And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing 
label1 Right  then the entire thing's one big heat sink 
label1 Good lord !
label1 Lock and load 
label1 I've got the Sword of Azeroth !
label1 There is no more Sheldon  I am the Swordmaster !
label1 Goodbye  peasants 
label1 I'm a rogue knight elf  don't you people read character descriptions ? Wait  wait  wait  somebody just clicked ' buy it now  '
label1 Wooh  I'm all sweaty  anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming  I just built a virtual pool 
label1 Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her 
label1 Well  at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her  and analyse the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again 
label1 The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye ?
label1 That depends  When I learn that I'm a robot  will I be able to handle it ?
label1 Uh  let me ask you this  When I learn that I'm a robot  would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics ?
label1 Of course not 
label1 Well  no 
label1 The internet's been down for half an hour 
label1 Oh  I've seen that look before  This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs  and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats  I don't know if I can take it 
label1 Oh  good lord 
label1 If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide 
label1 Okay  look  I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker  Nevertheless  I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you  You did not ask her out 
label1 No  No  now that was not my point  My point was  don't buy a cat 
label1 Oh  goody  we're getting a cat 
label1 Perfect  that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate 
label1 Not if you're a rugby team 
label1 Why would I join you ?
label1 Oh  no  no  no  well now  there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening 
label1 Of course  there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code 
label1 If I could of  I would of 
label1 Is the sex starting now ?
label1 Oh  okay  well then  calm down 
label1 Alright  alright  well  just  sit down  yes  sit down  now close your eyes 
label1 Just do it 
label1 It's a bio-feedback technique  it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation  I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience  it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid  I probably have it here somewhere 
label1 What should I tell her 
label1 Got it  So I'm assuming nothing venereal  I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back 
label1 Why would she be expecting me ?
label1 So  how was your date ?
label1 Score one for liquor and poor judgement 
label1 Put it on the back burner  Anyway  it occurs to me  if I ever did perfect a time machine  I'd just go into the past and give it to myself  thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place 
label1 Yeah  it really takes the pressure off 
label1 It's time travel  Leonard  I will have already done that 
label1 No  congratulations will have been in order  You know  I'm not going to enjoy this party 
label1 At the last department party  Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes 
label1 You know what's interesting about caves  Leonard ?
label1 Nothing 
label1 How's this ? Pleased to meet you  Dr Gablehouser  How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you  despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years  and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes  each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement  Mahalo 
label1 Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language 
label1 A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward 
label1 I can't believe he fired me 
label1 This isn't breakfast  it's an experiment 
label1 As do I 
label1 I don't want my job back  I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations  Before that I spent four years working on my thesis  Before that I was in college  and before that  I was in the fifth grade  This is my first day off in decades  and I'm going to savour it 
label1 I'm not just fixing my eggs  I'm fixing everyone's eggs 
label1 Yes  and evenly distributed amongst brown  white  free range  large  extra-large and jumbo 
label1 I'm taking a sabbatical  because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds 
label1 No it doesn't  Not unless the two doors are connected by relays  or there are motion sensors involved 
label1 Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door 
label1 Slow down  Slow down  please slow down 
label1 Look  you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars 
label1 Oh  I'm sorry  did I insult you ? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth ?
label1 Interesting  Anyway  that gives us a total weight of  let's say  4400 lb 
label1 Fine  We're travelling forward at  good Lord  51 miles an hour  Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned  still  by the time we come to a stop  we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us  an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death  mutilation and oh look  they built a new put-put course 
label1 This is great  Look at me  out in the real world of ordinary people  just living their ordinary  colourless  workaday lives 
label1 Uh  yes  but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket 
label1 No  this is fun  Oh  the thing about tomatoes  and I think you'll really enjoy this  is  they're shelved with the vegetables  but they're technically a fruit 
label1 Isn't it ?
label1 Well  there's some value to taking a multivitamin  but the human body can only absorb so much  what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine 
label1 Well then you'll want some manganese 
label1 That was fun  Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores 
label1 Well think about it  it's a product that doesn't spoil  and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years 
label1 Well  thirty  thirty five  hey  when did your mother go into menopause ?
label1 Oh  Penny  this is a natural human process  and we're talking about statistically significant savings  Now  if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle  are you fairly regular ?
label1 It's an experiment 
label1 Oh  that was a dead end  Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be 
label1 I read an article about Japanese scientists  who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals  and I thought hey  fish nightlights 
label1 It's a billion dollar idea  Shhhhh !
label1 Oh  no  no  no  No  I've too much to do 
label1 Shhhhh !
label1 That's just the beginning  I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company  Oh  glow in the dark tampons ! Leonard  we're going to be rich 
label1 I was working with luminous fish  and I thought  hey  loom ! Mom  what are you doing here ?
label1 I know  but why ?
label1 This is not a sarape  This is a poncho  A sarape is open at the sides  a poncho is closed  this is a poncho  and neither is a reason to call someone's mother 
label1 Well then buckle up  in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby 
label1 Yes  well I'm not a child  I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit  And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother 
label1 To my room  and no-one's allowed in 
label1 Morning 
label1 It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form 
label1 What do you want  mom ?
label1 What for ?
label1 I'm not going to apologise  I didn't say anything that wasn't true 
label1 Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked 
label1 Dr Gablehouser 
label1 Um  as you know  several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot  when I called you an idiot  And I just wanted to say that I was wrong  To point it out 
label1 I'm not quite sure  It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me 
label1 Thanks  mom  Mom ?
label1 Alright  I'm moving my infantry division  augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings  we flank the Tennessee Volunteers  and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg 
label1 Statistically unlikely 
label1 I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers  you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here 
label1 Can't we just go to Big Boy ? They only have one burger  The Big Boy 
label1 Fine  I'll have the Barbecue Burger 
label1 He asked her out once  it was an embarrassing failure 
label1 Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute  An alternate  and somewhat less likely interpretation  is that you could manufacture one  As in  oh look  Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb  aren't they adorable 
label1 You're a lucky man  Leonard 
label1 You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought 
label1 I said I could follow it  I didn't say I cared 
label1 Just come with me 
label1 What does it mean ?
label1 So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there 
label1 Oh  yes  but there's usually planning  courtship and advance notice  Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse 
label1 Well  there's Leonard 
label1 No  no  wait  hold on 
label1 I don't know what the protocol is here  Do I stay  do I leave ? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage ?
label1 Hi  Leonard  It's me  Sheldon  In the living room  I just  I wanted you to know I saw the tie  Message received  You're welcome  You carry on  Give my best to Lesley 
label1 Big boy !
label1 My equations  someone's tampered with my equations 
label1 Are you insane ? Are you out of your mind ? Are you '  hey look  that fixes the problem I've been having 
label1 You did this ?
label1 Who told you you could touch my board ?
label1 I don't come into your house and touch your board 
label1 Oh  that is so so '
label1 Inconsiderate  that is the adjective  inconsiderate 
label1 I'm coming 
label1 Boy  you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse 
label1 Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call ?
label1 She's not that intelligent 
label1 She got lucky 
label1 I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky 
label1 You know  I think I may have misjudged this restaurant 
label1 I won't go out on a limb  but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger 
label1 Way ahead of you  I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays  and just dropping Soup Plantation 
label1 Yeah  the name always confused me anyway  Soup Plantation  You can't grow soup 
label1 Terrific  you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future 
label1 Of course I'm listening  Blah blah  hopeless Penny delusion  blah blah blah 
label1 You know  we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command 
label1 No  I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back 
label1 Sure  if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun 
label1 Dancing ?
label1 The thing is  we're not ' 
label1 A Halloween party ?
label1 Yes  but are the costumes random  or genre specific ?
label1 What about comic-books ?
label1 Anime ?
label1 TV  film  D & D  Manga  Greek Gods  Roman Gods  Norse Gods '
label1 I don't care if anybody gets it  I'm going as the Doppler Effect 
label1 If I have to  I can demonstrate  Neeeeoooowwwww !
label1 So what time does the costume parade start ?
label1 Yeah  so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume  you know  most frightening  most authentic  most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle 
label1 Yes  It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer 
label1 See  people get it 
label1 I'm confused  If there's no costume parade  what are we doing here ?
label1 Telepathically ?
label1 Well  I actually might be able to help 
label1 Like Jane Goodall observing the apes  I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured  but patterns emerge  they have their own language if you will 
label1 That's as far as I've gotten 
label1 Good luck 
label1 Oh  I hardly think so 
label1 Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you ?
label1 Alright  but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA  analysing wreckage 
label1 Me ? I'll give you a hint  Neeeeooooowwwww !
label1 Close ! Neeeeeoooooowwwww !
label1 Neeeeeooooowwwwww !
label1 I'm the Doppler Effect 
label1 : Well  why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves 
label1 Yes  well  I'm the Doppler Effect 
label1 What do you suppose he's doing here ? Besides disrupting the local gravity field 
label1 Oh  snap  So I guess we'll be leaving now 
label1 You have a back-up hypothesis 
label1 Or maybe she wants to be friends  and he wants something more
label1 Yes  but you're much closer to it than he is 
label1 True  Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down ?
label1 Given the reaction to my costume  this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system 
label1 Yet another child left behind 
label1 Because he is neither tall nor immortal  and none of us could be The Flash 
label1 I'm not  No offence 
label1 Let me remind you  while my moral support is absolute  in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless 
label1 Happy Halloween 
label1 Tea  When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages  There there  You want to talk about it ?
label1 Good  There there was really all I had 
label1 Good night Leonard 
label1 Thank you for the clarification 
label1 Well I'm sure he'll be fine  He has his hammer 
label1 If we're all through playing mock the flawed technology  can we get on with Halo night  we were supposed to start at eight  it is now 8: 06 
label1 Yes  first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time  bathroom time or the pizza break 
label1 Oh  what fresh hell is this ?
label1 You know  I apologise for my earlier outburst  who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha ?
label1 Oh good grief 
label1 And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes  but on a more serious note it's 8: 13 and we're still not playing Halo 
label1 One on one ? We don't play one on one  we play teams  not one on one  One on one !
label1 Uh  no  The wheel was a great idea  Relativity was a great idea  This is a notion  and a rather sucky one at that 
label1 This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve  there are myriad weapons  vehicles and strategies to master  not to mention an extremely intricate back-story 
label1 Yes  but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh ' 
label1 Okay  this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned  you need to give them a chance to
label1 Okay  that's it  I don't know how  but she is cheating  No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game 
label1 You laugh now  you just wait until you need tech support 
label1 And another thing  there's a certain ethic to the game  Penny  a well estab '
label1 Well she could have said goodbye 
label1 It's called carpal tunnel syndrome  and quite frankly you deserve it 
label1 Where do I begin ?
label1 Well first  we don't have house guests  frankly if I could afford the rent I'd ask you to leave 
label1 Well  our earthquake supplies  we have a two day  two man kit 
label1 So  if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here  we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon 
label1 No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does 
label1 Okay  well since I'm obviously being ignored here  let's go over the morning schedule  I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20  plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly 
label1 I suggest no liquids after 11pm 
label1 Hmmph  wrong 
label1 Your head goes on the other end 
label1 Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment  I have awakened at 6:15  poured myself a bowl of cereal  added a quarter cup of 2 % milk  sat on this end of this couch  turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who 
label1 Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment  I have awakened at 6:15  poured myself a bowl of cereal ' 
label1 Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day 
label1 Okay  this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity  I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste 
label1 I'm Sheldon 
label1 Oh  terrific  now we're running a cute little B & B 
label1 Well then  it's all settled  Christie will stay with Howard  Penny can go back to her apartment  and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who  although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother 
label1 No more talking  everybody go 
label1 I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers 
label1 I'm sorry  we cannot do this without Wolowitz 
label1 Let me walk you through it  our standard is  the steamed dumpling appetizer  General So's chicken  beef with broccoli  shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main  Do you see the problem ?
label1 Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people 
label1 Fine  what do you want to eliminate  and who gets the extra dumpling 
label1 Then it is no longer a dumpling  once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich 
label1 He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good 
label1 No  if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree 
label1 And divide it how  I'm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz 
label1 Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food  she uses a fork  and she double dips her egg rolls 
label1 Exactly  but we'd have to if she was here 
label1 I'll know 
label1 What about the won-tons ?
label1 It's Halo night 
label1 Yes  Penny  we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team  I don't think I need to tell you what an honour this is 
label1 You go dancing every Wednesday 
label1 Then it's not dancing night 
label1 Yes  but you didn't portray her as completely irrational 
label1 Okay  assuming we could dance  which we can't  there are three of us and two of them 
label1 It's the Chinese restaurant all over again  I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men  each attempting to dance with 67 % of a woman 
label1 Your anger's not with me  sir  but with basic mathematics 
label1 The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe 
label1 No  I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3  As far as I know  sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems 
label1 My point 
label1 It's Halo night 
label1 I can't shoot now  I'm cloaking 
label1 That's why the call it cloaking  dead man 
label1 We said no tanks 
label1 Damn you  walletnookcom 
label1 The online description was completely misleading  they said eight slots plus removable ID  to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards  but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot  it's a nightmare 
label1 It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five 
label1 It says keep this on your person at all times 
label1 If I may  your parents probably don't consider this meddling  while arranged marriages are no longer the norm  Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children's lives 
label1 You seemed confused 
label1 It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession 
label1 What's not to love ?
label1 I suggest you go through with it 
label1 Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century  Up until then  arranged marriages were the norm  and it served society quite well 
label1 Understandable  but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity 
label1 No need  we have the special edition 
label1 Okay  there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try  but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead  their brain chemistry is far closer to ours 
label1 With certain obvious exceptions  Suicide  for example 
label1 I'll have a diet coke 
label1 Fine  I'll have a virgin cuba libre 
label1 Yes  And would you make it diet ?
label1 A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge 
label1 Bartenders are supposed to have people skills 
label1 And now we'll never know 
label1 Sorry I'm late 
label1 In a tall glass  with a lime wedge 
label1 So  how's Koothrappali d '  oh my Lord 
label1 That's Princess Punchali 
label1 No  no  Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess 
label1 It's a children's story 
label1 When I was a little boy and got sick  which was most of the time  my mother would read it to me  It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey  who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different  For some reason I related to it quite strongly 
label1 That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book  How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life ?
label1 You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali 
label1 A beloved character from an Indian folk tale 
label1 You Indian 
label1 The resemblance is remarkable  I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair 
label1 I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can 
label1 It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars  and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips 
label1 Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom 
label1 Luckily for you  she could have you beheaded 
label1 I could eat 
label1 How would I know  do you have a low sperm count ?
label1 What did I do ?
label1 And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring 
label1 And boring  her words 
label1 Okay  well  good night 
label1 We ate  She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks  nothing I didn't already know  and I came home 
label1 Look at me  look at me  I've got goosebumps 
label1 No  we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet 
label1 Someone in Sezchuan province  China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off 
label1 They found the remote controlled cars 
label1 You know  in the future  when we're disembodied brains in jars  we're going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted 
label1 I know  I read it before I threw it out 
label1 Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers  who wouldn't recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech  Which  if I were there  it would be 
label1 Leonard  please don't take this the wrong way  but the day you win a Nobel Prize  is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets 
label1 No we don't  We have to take in nourishment  expel waste  and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying  everything else is optional 
label1 You can't  I'm the lead author 
label1 I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea  Not to put too fine a point on it  but I was throwing you a bone  You're welcome 
label1 It doesn't need proving 
label1 And I forbid it 
label1 Uh  just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly 
label1 Penny  just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence 
label1 Oh dear God !
label1 A little misunder '  Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding 
label1 Oh  I hadn't thought about it like that  I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil 
label1 Excuse me  little idea ?
label1 In what words then  exactly
label1 What did he say ?
label1 Don't you ever speak to me again 
label1 Have fun presenting my lucky hunch 
label1 Then why did you say it 
label1 Were you trying to impress Penny ?
label1 How'd that work out for you ?
label1 Libido 1  truth zero 
label1 And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering  it's undignified and bite me 
label1 Goodbye Penny 
label1 Oh  I see  was the apple falling on Newton's head  was that just an anecdote ?
label1 You continue to underestimate me  my good man 
label1 As I have explained repeatedly  unlike you  I don't need validation from lesser minds  No offence 
label1 Oh  please  I admit  that spherical chicken joke  that was hilarious  But it was straight downhill from there 
label1 Okay  that is it 
label1 Then I'll settle for an aneurysm 
label1 You hit me  You saw him  he hit me 
label1 So it was working 
label1 Oh we'll see about that
label1 You could have offered me a ride home 
label1 Well that's not much of an apology  but I'll take it 
label1 Yes  I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head  It was uncalled for 
label1 Forget your suit  look at my arms waving  I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin 
label1 Okay  then riddle me this  Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor  why would Skynet  an artificial computer intelligence  bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot ?
label1 Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes 
label1 I don't guess  As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation  although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot 
label1 I have a conclusion based on an observation 
label1 I think that's a week from Tuesday at six 
label1 You just lied to Penny 
label1 And you did it so casually  no rapid breathing  no increase in perspiration 
label1 So  lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath 
label1 No  I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago 
label1 I need to speak to you 
label1 It's important 
label1 Never mind  I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle  you're in no state to talk 
label1 I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny 
label1 You could have told her the truth 
label1 Is that a relevant factor ?
label1 Then I suppose you could have agreed to go 
label1 I would suggest something to the effect of  singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you  and if you disagree  I'd recommend you have a CAT scan  to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain 
label1 I was not aware of that 
label1 Oh  alright  Leonard 
label1 When we played chess earlier  you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again  Goodnight 
label1 I was analysing our lie  and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse 
label1 Well  sir  my trousers will not be igniting today 
label1 Of course I do  My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder  Colorado  It's accurate to one tenth of a second  But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical 
label1 Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium ?
label1 Yes  well  he lied 
label1 He lied  and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it 
label1 Hungry ? Tired ? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit 
label1 To help you 
label1 She was going to see through your lie eventually  so I told her that you were lying to protect me 
label1 Yea  who most people call Leo  but he also answers to Lee  remember that  it's important 
label1 Details  Leonard  the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details 
label1 No  I made him up  I think you'd call him Lee 
label1 Yes  if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page  an online blog depicting his descent into drug use  and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmonycom 
label1 No  of course not  there's no cousin Leo  there's no intervention  focus Leonard 
label1 We just leave the house on Friday night  and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab 
label1 For a noble purpose  to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin  which I'm assuming is embarrassing  yes ?
label1 Un-unravelable 
label1 Well  uh  Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent  which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium  given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian 
label1 Good for you 
label1 Break a leg 
label1 It's a very nice community  The Queen Mary is docked there  once the largest ocean liner in the world  it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner 
label1 No  no  no  Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front  and even then it's iffy 
label1 Sadly  it's not  Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle  but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab 
label1 Because Leo is a middle child 
label1 You didn't read the bio  did you ? He's not just a middle child  he's the quintessential middle child  from a broken home to boot  Psychologically speaking  the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab 
label1 Excuse me  we just went over this  As the quintessential middle child  your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention 
label1 For your information  this is all based on solid research  stick with the character profile I wrote for you 
label1 I'm sorry  Leonard  this is Toby Loobenfeld  he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab  but he also minored in theatre at MIT 
label1 Well  you see  while Leo would not have gone into rehab  it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel  and coming home with us 
label1 No  We're going with middle child  and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production 
label1 Subtextually  of course 
label1 Unfortunately  we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab 
label1 But we did convince him to leave the motel  Come say hello  Leo  this is Penny  our friend and neighbour 
label1 Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction 
label1 There have been studies 
label1 Your parents made the right decision 
label1 He's a homeless drug addict  Leonard  where is he going to go ? Boy  you have a lot to learn about lying 
label1 Checkmate 
label1 Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess  perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed 
label1 It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels 
label1 From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion  All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here 
label1 I don't need you to guess  I need you to know  now when did the symptoms first appear ?
label1 Friday  was that morning or afternoon ?
label1 Think woman  who blew their nose and when ?
label1 Oh please  if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago  Somewhere between tool using and cave painting  homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose 
label1 Thanks for your consideration  now please leave 
label1 Leonard ! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat 
label1 When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me  these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance 
label1 I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down 
label1 Oh  dear God 
label1 Leonard  where are you ?
label1 At six-thirty in the morning ?
label1 On Sunday ?
label1 Well  I didn't hear the phone ring 
label1 Well  as I predicted  I am sick  My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am  and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate 
label1 No  Not only that  it has shifted from clear to milky green 
label1 What else would I drink ? Gasses ? Solids ? Ionised plasma ?
label1 I want soup 
label1 We don't have soup 
label1 In the lab ?
label1 Howard  I'm sick 
label1 I want soup 
label1 Penny  I have an IQ of 187  don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it ?
label1 I did not think of that  Clearly febrile delirium is setting in  please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for 
label1 Well  my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons 
label1 Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons ?
label1 Then surprise me 
label1 Thanks for bringing me home 
label1 Good  Good 
label1 Wait  where are you going ?
label1 Well  of course  but  not by myself 
label1 Well  once  When I was fifteen  and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany 
label1 No  visiting professor  Anyway  the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to  and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia 
label1 Based on what happened next  I assume it means ' would you like an enema ? '
label1 Well  my mom used to give me sponge baths 
label1 Wait  Will you please rub this on my chest 
label1 Vaporub makes my hands smell funny 
label1 No  no  counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats 
label1 Can you sing ' Soft Kitty ' 
label1 I'll teach you  ' Soft kitty  warm kitty  little ball of fur  happy kitty  sleepy kitty  purr purr purr  Now you 
label1 Little ball of fur  Keep rubbing 
label1 Leonard  I'm hungry !
label1 Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us ?
label1 I'm very congested 
label1 Can you go to the kitchen  and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus 
label1 Under the sink  yellow Tupperware bowl 
label1 Here's the problem with teleportation 
label1 Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location  and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly  you would not have actually transported the individual  You would have destroyed him in one location  and recreated him in another 
label1 Personally  I would never use a transporter  Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon 
label1 So  you see it too 
label1 Not bad  I myself started graduate school at fourteen 
label1 Excuse me  that is my research  and it is by no means a dead end 
label1 You can count on us  we're on it  What the hell do you mean  dead end 
label1 I sense a disturbance in the force 
label1 He's not wrong  Alright  and this is my office 
label1 Nope  Goodbye 
label1 Oh  alright  this is my desk  these are my books  this is my door  please close it behind you  Goodbye 
label1 Keen observation  goodbye 
label1 Leonard 
label1 Get him out 
label1 You think I haven't considered it ? You really think I haven't considered it ?
label1 Get him out Leonard 
label1 Why waste food  In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it  they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes 
label1 Yes  but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years  and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg 
label1 Well of course you don't  you've never excelled at anything 
label1 I've decided you're right  My career is not over 
label1 But  since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless  I just have to find something else to focus on 
label1 So I've decided  I'm going to collaborate with you 
label1 What exactly is it you do ? I know you chatter on about it all the time  but I've never really paid attention 
label1 Oh  sure you do  Now  see  what's this here in the schematic  is that a laser array ?
label1 No  Hmmm  What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon ?
label1 Are you sure ?
label1 Pretty sure's not very scientific  is this how you normally work  just hunches and guesses and stuff ?
label1 Alright 
label1 If you're concerned about sharing credit with me  you're name can go first I'm going 
label1 Engineering  Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream  Hello  oompah-loompahs of science 
label1 I just came by to say hello 
label1 Well  up until now I've had better things to do  So  what are we making today ?
label1 Uh  huh  So it's a shelf ?
label1 Now  I notice you're using titanium  did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes  they're lighter  cheaper and half twice the tensile strength 
label1 And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you  bubbula  But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes 
label1 Did Leonard tell you to say that ?
label1 Huh  It can't be a coincidence  There must be some causal link I'm missing 
label1 Curiouser and curiouser 
label1 No  no  please  come in  Yeah  I think you'll appreciate this  very exciting 
label1 Something remarkable  Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared  thank you very much  I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize  Look  I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert 
label1 You know  it's like the baseball movie  build it and they will come 
label1 We'll make it nice  put out a spread 
label1 Of course he has  the oracle told us little Neo was the one  You can see the Matrix  can't you 
label1 I really don't understand your objections  Professor Goldfarb  why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land ?
label1 We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem 
label1 Said Pharoah to Moses 
label1 Hey  Howard  You're a Jew  If there was another wailing wall  exactly like the one in Jerusalem  but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs  would you still be able to wail at it ? Okay  it's definitely me 
label1 Youngest till the cyborgs rise up !
label1 Screw him  he was weak 
label1 Oh  please  For Vulcans  mating  or  if you will  Pon Farr  it's an extremely private matter 
label1 Well count me out 
label1 You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition ? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary ? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle ? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish ?
label1 By that reasoning we should also play bridge  hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition 
label1 No  don't 
label1 Or the one  Dammit  I'll do it 
label1 I don't  Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures  thus intimidating ones opponent 
label1 Poor choice  Gram for gram  no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant 
label1 He does 
label1 And of course  the answer is giant magneto resistance 
label1 But I answered  it's called teamwork 
label1 By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal 
label1 And of course it's Gravity Probe B 
label1 What do manners have to do with it ? This is war  Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again ?
label1 The objective of the competition is to give correct answers  if I know them  why shouldn't I give them ?
label1 Oh please  you don't even have a PhD 
label1 Good idea  I need my wrist brace  all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury 
label1 Leonard  excellent  I want to show you something 
label1 Army Ants 
label1 Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium ?
label1 Oh neat  what's the occasion ?
label1 No you didn't 
label1 Okay  I don't know where you just came from  but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there  ergo the team did not meet 
label1 Well  I'm sorry  is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun ?
label1 I see  Well  At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together  and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears 
label1 You're welcome  One more thing 
label1 It's on  bitch 
label1 Leslie Winkle ?
label1 Yes  well  I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so  whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me  returns on its original trajectory  and adheres to you 
label1 Formal protest 
label1 The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt 
label1 And of course  the answer is Technetium 
label1 Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
label1 A sigma particle 
label1 How do you know anything about physics ?
label1 Well that's a delightful little story  but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything  I answer the questions 
label1 Hey look  now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia  but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist 
label1 Well it's not what he said 
label1 I want a different question 
label1 Formal protest 
label1 Informal protest 
label1 No  I decline to provide one 
label1 That's your opinion 
label1 I don't understand the question 
label1 That trophy is meaningless  I forfeited  therefore you did not win 
label1 Alright that is very immature 
label1 Absolutely 
label1 William Shatner 
label1 Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart 
label1 Formal protest 
label1 Well  this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster  I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat 
label1 I know  it's basic culinary science 
label1 You bid $ 800 
label1 There's only 30 seconds left in the auction 
label1 I wonder why no-one else bid  this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia 
label1 Need you ask ? But I still don't understand why no-one else bid 
label1 I understand why no-one else bid 
label1 In a venn diagram  that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets ' no longer want my time machine and ' need $ 800 ' 
label1 I've been meaning to ask you  do you think we should make a call about that ?
label1 It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go  basic physics 
label1 Then I have a simple solution  go up to the roof  hop over to the next building  there's a small gap  don't look down if you're subject to vertigo  and use their stairwell 
label1 Oh  I never joke when it comes to vertigo 
label1 For what it's worth  I thought it was humorous 
label1 I don't know what you were worried about  I think it really works in the room 
label1 The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future  which society had splintered into two factions  the sub-terranean Morlocks  who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy 
label1 Gentlemen  I know we said we'd take turns  but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here 
label1 Alright  I think we're going to need some ground rules  in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine  I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine 
label1 Hold on  Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term  do you mean move it every other month  or twice a month ?
label1 Wait a minute  I'd want to see that too 
label1 But if we all go back to the same point in time  Bell's lab is going to get very crowded  he'll know something's up 
label1 If I remember correctly  Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 50273  which will be January 10
label1 Time machine 
label1 Again  time machine 
label1 It only moves in time  It would be worse than useless in a swamp 
label1 Leonard  it's two in the morning 
label1 So it's my turn  Why did you set it for the day before yesterday ?
label1 You can't  If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past  you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it  ergo you would still have it  This is a classic rookie time travel mistake 
label1 Same paradox  If you were to travel back in time and  say  knock me unconscious  you would not then have the conversation that irritated you  motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious 
label1 It won't change the past 
label1 Are you upset about something ?
label1 Well  it was a number of things  First the late hour  then your demeanour seems very low energy  plus your irritability '
label1 Oh  wait  Did you want to talk about what's bothering you ?
label1 Wow  I'm on fire tonight 
label1 I disagree  Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine  That failure clearly stands on its own 
label1 In addition  your premise is flawed  In the original film  Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine  In Back to the Future  Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother 
label1 It's still my turn 
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 Well is that really necessary  If you need money you can always sell blood  And semen 
label1 What's the number  I'll match it 
label1 What's the exchange rate 
label1 Who cares  as long as you pick me 
label1 Little Miss ' grown ups don't play with toys '  If I were to go into that apartment right now  would I find Beanie Babies ? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies ? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts ? Hello  Hello Kitty !
label1 We have to get rid of the time machine 
label1 Thank you for coming by 
label1 How can you be late  I wasn't expecting you at all 
label1 Oh  alright  this is Missy  Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard 
label1 She's my twin sister  she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it 
label1 How exactly would one measure a sense of humour ? A humourmometer ?
label1 Rajesh 
label1 The papers could have been mailed  Mom just sent you here to spy on me  didn't she 
label1 They call me a genius because I'm a genius  Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds  and that I'm having regular bowel movements  Enjoy the wedding  goodbye 
label1 They were not friends  they were imaginary colleagues 
label1 No we don't 
label1 So what ? I don't issue invitations to your mother 
label1 And don't ever call me Shelly 
label1 Is that what that was ? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical 
label1 Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs  they are no more alike than any other siblings 
label1 I'm not ignoring my sister  I'm ignoring all of you 
label1 Excuse me  can I interject something  I'm ordering pizza online  is everyone okay with pepperoni ?
label1 I guess  Don't worry  I was going to order you cheeseless 
label1 That's okay  Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about 
label1 Hmmm ? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable  It's noteworth that at other points in history  heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence 
label1 I didn't say it was fascinating  I said it was noteworthy 
label1 Oh  Okay  You know  I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but  we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought 
label1 What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis 
label1 I don't understand  Yes  we shared a uterus for nine months  but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways 
label1 I hadn't considered that  We do share DNA 
label1 You're right  If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes  they'll have to go through me 
label1 Alright  that's enough juvenile squabbling  stop it  stop it I say  I'm going to settle this right now  Neither of you are good enough for my sister 
label1 You're out too  by the way 
label1 It's nothing personal  I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie 
label1 How so ?
label1 In principle you have a point  but as a practical matter  need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex 
label1 This has nothing to do with religion  This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny  tiny man who still lives with his mother 
label1 Am I ? Here  Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister 
label1 Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone ? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me  ' '
label1 Truthfully  I've never given it any thought  but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential 
label1 Let me explain  You see  I'm a superior genetic mutation  an improvement on the existing mediocre stock 
label1 That would be you  But residing within you is the potential for another me  Perhaps even taller  smarter and less prone to freckling  a Sheldon 20 if you will 
label1 Exactly  Now  I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with  If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced 
label1 Not at all  Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation 
label1 I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird  You know  a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds  Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food  leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death  Luckily for you  that's where the metaphor ended 
label1 I have an alternate proposal 
label1 You donate eggs  We will place them in cryogenic storage  I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs  have them fertilized and implanted in you  that way everybody wins 
label1 Correction  Missy can date whoever she wants 
label1 I weep for humanity 
label1 Really ?
label1 You tell people I'm a rocket scientist ?
label1 I'm a theoretical physicist 
label1 What's the difference ?
label1 We might as well stop  it's a stalemate  You're beating me in tetris  but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf 
label1 He can't eat cheesecake  he's lactose intolerant 
label1 What about the cream cheese frosting 
label1 For the record  that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer  who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments  that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum 
label1 It's actually based on very sound theories  his mother published a paper on it 
label1 It was obviously effective  Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist  Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it 
label1 What would we talk about ? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of  and you know I don't care for chit-chat 
label1 Well alright  but I don't see this as a promising endeavour 
label1 I hardly think so  Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party 
label1 I think a birthday party is a terrible idea  I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish 
label1 Year after year  I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles  not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation 
label1 Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing  loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity 
label1 The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators 
label1 Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor 
label1 That's because I didn't bring one 
label1 The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense 
label1 I accept your premise  I reject your conclusion 
label1 Oh  Fair enough 
label1 Question  how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party ? I don't drive  and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station  I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers 
label1 Yes  but they have DVD burners over here  Leonard needs a DVD burner 
label1 You mean  like a sweater ?
label1 Is it the geometry that makes it fun 
label1 Something he wouldn't buy for himself  Something fun  Something like oh  an 80211 n wireless router 
label1 What do you think 
label1 He doesn't need them  he's already got a 640 connect switch
label1 Penny ! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift  I'm going to do it right  I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did 
label1 Instead of a titanium centrifuge  my parents bought me wow  this is hard  They got me a motorised dirt bike 
label1 Really ?
label1 I know everything about this stuff 
label1 No  no  no  no  she doesn't want that  she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender 
label1 It depends on what Bus you have 
label1 Okay  we don't have that in stock  but I can special order it for you 
label1 Yes  well  apparently neither does anyone else 
label1 Yeah  1-2- 3-4 is not a secure password 
label1 Possibly  but unverified 
label1 That's what you did  I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase 
label1 How am I supposed to know that ? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter 
label1 Okay  where were we ?
label1 Twelfth century code of chivalry  not exactly current  You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply 
label1 Howard  I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson  I obviously didn't make my point with those people 
label1 I like tangerine chicken  I'm not getting tangerine chicken 
label1 Actually  I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling  Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character  now I just find him to be whiny and annoying 
label1 I'd love to  but I don't have tangerine chicken 
label1 A second what ? Pair of underwear ?
label1 Why me ? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz ?
label1 Yes  I suppose he is 
label1 Not necessarily  I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard  Just the other day I discovered  he not only has a loofah  he hides it  Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah ? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally  but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process  '
label1 We're not done ?
label1 Ach  why not ? We're already through the looking glass anyway 
label1 Well  he didn't actually say anything  but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia 
label1 There are a number of options and  I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities  air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice 
label1 A little crush ? Well I suppose so  in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy 
label1 Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon '
label1 Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with  Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees ?
label1 The last one worked out well for Koothrappali  He got a free iPod  Oh  glare !
label1 I would not say that  No-one would say that  a light year is a unit of distance  not time 
label1 Draft  You see people hear the word year and they think duration  Foot pound has the same problem  that's a unit of work  not of weight 
label1 It's a common mistake 
label1 Okay  I think this will be my seat 
label1 Well  let's see  We might consider Schrodinger's Cat 
label1 No  That's Mrs Grossinger  And she doesn't have a cat  she has a Mexican hairless  annoying little animal  yip yip yip yip '
label1 Sorry  you diverted me  Anyway  in 1935  Erwin Schrodinger  in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics  he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time  Now  since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released  until the box is opened  the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead 
label1 Well of course you don't get it  I haven't made it yet  You'd have to be psychic to get it  and there's no such thing as psychic 
label1 No  no  no  no  no  no  Let me start again  In 1935  Erwin Schrodinger '
label1 I can see that  Unless you're planning on running a marathon  choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy 
label1 A mistake involving Penny ? Okay  you'll have to narrow it down 
label1 Then don't 
label1 Other people might be interested 
label1 Ah  then your meal choice is appropriate  Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion 
label1 Well  if we accept your premise  and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely  bitter old man with no progeny  The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind 
label1 Alright  what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion ?
label1 Schrodinger's Cat 
label1 You sound surprised  Mmm  hou zi shui zai li du 
label1 They were clever  Leonard  They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing 
label1 Oh  even I know that's lame 
label1 Interesting  her jaws are clenched  no tongue access  clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans 
label1 Please  you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement 
label1 Oh  hi Penny  FYI  the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only  and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I'd avoid using that for your delicates 
label1 Oh  good Lord  Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock ?
label1 I would prefer that you not  but I won't go so far as to forbid it 
label1 Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity ? Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate 
label1 Well  for one thing  she was French  For another  it was literature 
label1 Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics ?
label1 Do you know any card tricks ?
label1 Why would you lie about that ?
label1 You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate ?
label1 You're asking me to keep a secret ?
label1 Well I'm sorry  but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret  so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping  You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis 
label1 Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour  One has to be concerned not only about what one says  but about facial expression  autonomic reflexes  when I try to deceive  I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility 
label1 Physiologically impossible 
label1 So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences ?
label1 Interesting  See  one more question  and perhaps I should have led with this  when did we become friends ?
label1 I  e  I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa  but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility  I could be Batman 
label1 Why are you asking me  I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me  nor do I have any method of learning such things 
label1 Nothing  You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists 
label1 I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things  sir 
label1 Well I might ask you the same question  Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me ? But exist between you and Penny  A person to whom I barely speak 
label1 There's no reason to bring my looks into this  Good day  Leonard 
label1 I said Good Day !
label1 Why don't you take a minute to decide
label1 I'm constitutionally incapable  That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider  located beneath a fake agricultural station 125 miles south east of Travers City  Michigan  Which you did not hear about from me 
label1 There doesn't have to be a reason 
label1 Not necessarily  This is a classic example of munchausen's trilemma  Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression  or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements  or it's ultimately circular  i  e   I'm moving out because I'm moving out 
label1 Leonard  I don't see how I could have made it any simpler 
label1 It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag  Recommended by the department of homeland security  And Sarah Connor 
label1 Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends 
label1 Excuse me  but isn't hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna  one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder ?
label1 Don't be ridiculous  you love trains 
label1 This is a very old building 
label1 Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials ?
label1 I can't believe I didn't bring my gieger counter  You know  I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it 
label1 I'm kidding  I packed it  It was a joke  I was subverting the conversational expectations  I believe they call that the  um  old switcheroo 
label1 Actually  I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit 
label1 I've never slept on an air mattress before  No lumbar support whatsoever 
label1 I don't see any way to get a park bench in here 
label1 No  that's fine  I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle 
label1 Now  only if you want to 
label1 Meh  That poster of Halle Berry's a little unnerving 
label1 She's like my fourth favourite catwoman 
label1 Yeah  Julie Newmar  Michelle Pfieffer  Eartha Kitt and then her 
label1 Oh  I forgot about Lee Meriwether 
label1 That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman  There's Julie Newmar  Michelle Pfieffer  Eartha Kitt  Lee Meriwether '
label1 I'm trying  I'm counting catwomen  She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though 
label1 But she's not my favourite of the X-Men  in order that would be Wolverine  Cyclops  oh wait  I forgot Professor X  Professor X  Wolverine  Cyclops  Iceman  then Storm  Angel  the Beast  oh wait  Nightcrawler  Professor X  Nightcrawler  Wolverine  Cyclops  Iceman  then Storm  Angel ' 
label1 I'm ba-ack !
label1 I promised Penny 
label1 That I wouldn't tell you the secret  Shhhhh !
label1 Mom smokes in the car  Jesus is okay with it  but we can't tell Dad 
label1 I'm Batman  Shhhhh !
label1 Okay  I'll tell you  but you can't tell Leonard 
label1 Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard 
label1 I drank milk that tasted funny 
label1 I know  most of your work is extremely derivative  Don't worry  that's not a secret  Everybody knows 
label1 Worst Renaissance Fair ever 
label1 Oh-ho ! Really ? Well here's another nit for you  The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene 
label1 Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century  If anything they would have said ' huzzah ! '
label1 Renaissance fair ? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair 
label1 That was not fifteenth century soap  my God those people need to learn you can't just put ' ye olde in front of anything and expect to get away with it 
label1 You're wearing modern underwear ?
label1 I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen 
label1 Don't be silly  I borrowed one of your pillow cases 
label1 Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary  the word plenty has been redefined to mean two 
label1 Her research methodology is sloppy  she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity  and to make matters worse she's often mean to me 
label1 If we were  the food would be better 
label1 Hello to you  insufficiently intelligent person 
label1 Well  if you'll excuse me  I'm going to go do work that promises significant results  as opposed to what you do  which does not  Yeah  you heard me 
label1 Great news  My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64 
label1 You know what this means  don't you ? Break out the Red Bull  it's time to rock Mario old school 
label1 But it's Friday  Friday's always vintage game night  Look  mom included the memory card  we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia 
label1 Well then  no problem  I have three controllers  the more the merrier 
label1 Oh  well you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion 
label1 Well  statistically speaking '
label1 Leonard  I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurately measured by normal tests  how much scarcer could I be ?
label1 You want me to leave the apartment ?
label1 You mean just go someplace else and be someplace else ?
label1 Well  why should I leave  this is my apartment too 
label1 Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator 
label1 I'm a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard  get this  has a date 
label1 What if I choke on my popcorn  who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre 
label1 No popcorn at the mo listen to yourself 
label1 I don't drink coffee 
label1 What do they have ?
label1 Pastries such as bearclaws ?
label1 Leslie Winkle  Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world  why does it have to be Leslie Winkle ?
label1 Oh please  The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space 
label1 I have to make pee-pee 
label1 I'm sorry  I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair 
label1 I don't care  There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort 
label1 You mean like Spock ?
label1 Fascinating 
label1 If you're having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato  or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology 
label1 It's not hard  It's simple  You can either sit with me  your friend  colleague and roommate  or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with 
label1 Alright  let's say I go to dinner alone  And during the meal I have to use the rest room  How do I know someone's not touching my food ?
label1 Penny  hold on  Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard ?
label1 Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy 
label1 Leslie Winkle  Penny  She belittles my research 
label1 She called me dumbass 
label1 Given this situation  I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard 
label1 No  that response is unacceptable to me 
label1 Smart ? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart 
label1 You continue to underestimate my abilities madam 
label1 Wait a minute  why am I doing all the giving here ? If Leonard's really my friend  why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle ?
label1 Oh now you're just making stuff up 
label1 Oh Mario  If only I could control everyone the way I control you  Hop  you little plumber  hop  hop  hop 
label1 Leonard  you are my friend  And friends support their friends  apparently  So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie 
label1 I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist  who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory  You kids have fun 
label1 I'm listening  amuse me 
label1 Balderdash  Matter clearly consists of tiny strings 
label1 Look on the bright side 
label1 That's a temporal anomaly  Corn dogs didn't come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century 
label1 Fellow warriors  this is Sheldor the Conqueror  We are about to enter Axel's fortress  Now this is a long run  so let's do another bladder check  Alright Barry  we'll wait for you again  but you really should see a doctor 
label1 You appear to have put your car key in the door lock  are you aware of that ?
label1 Alright then 
label1 Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly ?
label1 Well that's not surprising  That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders  whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system 
label1 You're welcome  Point of inquiry  why did you put your car key in the door lock ?
label1 Well  the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who  well they have a characteristic facial bone structure ' 
label1 Well  actually  insects are a dietary staple in many cultures  they're almost pure protein 
label1 I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag  But returning to your key conundrum  perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you 
label1 And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology ?
label1 There there 
label1 Alright then 
label1 Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm 
label1 Make yourself comfortable 
label1 The Conqueror 
label1 AFK  I'm playing Age of Conan  an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E  Howard's Conan the Barbarian 
label1 Sheldor  back online 
label1 AFK  Away from keyboard 
label1 What does that stand for ?
label1 Yes  but what does it stand for ?
label1 Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on 
label1 Just click on them  Congratulations  you are now a level three warrior 
label1 It doesn't matter  right now you're looking for treasure 
label1 You're okay  if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots 
label1 Well let's see  uh  she attempted to open her apartment with her car key  because her face is overly Midwestern  um  she hasn't had sex in six months  and she ate a fly 
label1 They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid  but solid under the percussive action of the speaker 
label1 Do you have the enchanted sword ?
label1 You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger  my Lord it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again 
label1 Well  have you been to the Temple of Mithra ?
label1 No  no  no  it's oh for God's sakes  gimme 
label1 You're going to have to learn to do these things for yourself  Penny 
label1 There you go  one enchanted sword 
label1 That girl needs to get a life 
label1 Danger  danger 
label1 You're in my bedroom 
label1 I'm not wearing pyjama bottoms 
label1 I spilled grape juice 
label1 I can't wear different pyjamas  these are my Monday pyjamas  Penny  people cannot be in my bedroom 
label1 You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle ?
label1 Of course it's not  you're only a level 25  the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder 
label1 I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job  as head of the department  to mediate all inter-departmental disputes  University policy manual chapter four  subsection two  mediation of inter-departmental disputes 
label1 If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty 
label1 Oh yeah  well  you wouldn't even be nominated  Dr Gablehauser  I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run  All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock '
label1 Hello  Penny  this is not a good time  No  I told you  you're not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls  You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest  and one should be a level 35 healer  Penny  I can't log on and help you  We'll talk when I get home 
label1 Leonard  you have to do something about Penny  She is interfering with my sleep  she's interfering with my work  and if I had another significant aspect of my life  I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too 
label1 Well  yes  but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in  If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening 
label1 I did  I told her  I texted her  I sent out a very emphatic twitter  I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone  I don't know what else to do 
label1 I don't know  but if you don't figure something out  I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with 
label1 Danger  danger 
label1 Oh yeah  well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males '  oh  I'm too tired to do this 
label1 She comes into my room  No-one's supposed to be in my room 
label1 Hang on  Leonard  while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist  or a human being for that matter  we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness 
label1 Some what ? Oh  yes  some sexual intercourse 
label1 Yeah  yeah  enough debate  I'm going to take action 
label1 Would you like to be ?
label1 There  problem solved 
label1 Stay close to the wall  Avoid the mummies 
label1 I must say  you're playing very well for a woman of 23 ?
label1 Right  22 
label1 Frenzy stance 
label1 So listen  would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands  or staying at home curled up with a good book ?
label1 These are market research questions  I'm filling out the online registration for your game 
label1 Drink a healing potion 
label1 Good to know  Big old five 
label1 Leonard  this is Tom 
label1 Yes  you were very clear  as was everyone else at the table  Tom  however  has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny 
label1 No  of course not  No  I used trickery and deceit 
label1 Tom is a paramedic with the fire department  but he's going to med school at night  uh  he likes the outdoors  and  uh  strong women who initiate sex 
label1 I'm surprised you struck out with Penny  Apparently she's a big old five 
label1 Oh  good  you got my note  Penny  I'd like you to meet Tom  uh  Penny  this is Tom  Tom  may I present Penny 
label1 Can we talk about this later 
label1 But wouldn't you prefer to socialise with Tom  who is a sexually passive outdoorsman 
label1 I'll tell you why 
label1 I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers 
label1 Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence  Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry 
label1 Excuse me  Thirty what  under thirty what  to watch what ?
label1 If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that 
label1 I'm confused  Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included ?
label1 What people ?
label1 Yeah  but exactly who are these people ? What are their credentials  how are they qualified  what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty ?
label1 In general  yes 
label1 Oh  there's my missing neutrino  You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge  weren't you  you little subatomic Dickens ?
label1 Here  look  look  I found my missing neutrino 
label1 Apologise  for what ?
label1 I sense you're trying to tell me something 
label1 How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him ? When I was eleven  my sister bought our father a ' world's greatest dad coffee mug  and frankly the man coasted until the day he died 
label1 But I'm not 
label1 Fine  what do you want me to do ?
label1 Dr Gablehauser 
label1 Well  you didn't discover him  you merely noticed he was here  much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17 
label1 Oh  sorry 
label1 He gets a new office  I can't even get paper towels in the men's room ?
label1 Damn  this is hard 
label1 Aaaah !
label1 Right  a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself 
label1 There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where  when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him  and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin  Superstitious nonsense of course  but one can see their point 
label1 I can make it  but I won't 
label1 A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind 
label1 Even though the menu description specifies shredded ?
label1 Brown rice  not white ?
label1 Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market ?
label1 Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight ?
label1 Then there's no excuse for this chicken  You know  this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood 
label1 That's Northwest Texas  I'm from East Texas  the Gulf region  home to many Vietnamese shrimpers 
label1 No  Anyway  when I was eight  a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat  Lucky 
label1 While others mourned Lucky  I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs  A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night  and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command 
label1 Please  no  nothing so pedestrian  I wanted a griffin 
label1 Yes  half eagle  half lion 
label1 Irrelevant  See  I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one  but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen  Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them 
label1 My point is  if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow  undeserved fame  perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort 
label1 That's one option  but who has the time ? But consider this  the Japanese  they're doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence  now  you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney  next thing you know  we're playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln 
label1 Uh  for the record  it could kill us to meet new people  They could be murderers  or the carriers of unusual pathogens  and I'm not insane  my mother had me tested 
label1 He should share our love of technology 
label1 Good morning  Leonard 
label1 Yeah  we're going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work  I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep  I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me 
label1 Oh  just because your career's been stagnant for a few years  that's no reason to give up 
label1 Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas ?
label1 Then you can drive  Let's go 
label1 You did 
label1 I didn't  Let's go 
label1 But how am I going to get to work ?
label1 I can't take the bus any more  They don't have seatbelts  And they won't let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords 
label1 I didn't try  I succeeded  For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus 
label1 Don't talk to me like I'm a child  Now  take me to return my star wars sheets !
label1 But I don't drive  and I can't take the bus 
label1 Penny  Didn't you recently state that you and I are friends ?
label1 I'm sorry  I didn't realize I was interrupting your morning prayers  When you're done  we'll go 
label1 Thank you for driving me to work 
label1 Oh  good  I'm not keeping you from anything  Your check engine light is on 
label1 Typically that's an indicator  To  you know  check your engine 
label1 Well  actually  that would be all the more reason to  you know  check your engine 
label1 If it were fine  the light wouldn't be on  That's why the manufacturer installed that light  to let you know it's not fine 
label1 Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating  talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one's reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol 
label1 Of course not 
label1 You're going up Euclid Avenue ?
label1 Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue 
label1 Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies  but it has speed bumps  which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time  making it the less efficient choice  But you have the conn  Of course  if you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps  I withdraw my previous objection  Here's a fun question  Do you know what the most common street name is ?
label1 The answer's tricky  It's Second Street  You see  you'd think it would be First Street  but in most towns  First Street eventually gets renamed to something else  you know  like Main Street  Broad Street  Michigan Avenue  Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that  We also play games  Would you like to play one ?
label1 Oh  come on  it's fun  Ooh ! Another bump  Okay  I'll say an element  and uh  you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said  okay ? I'll start  Helium  Now  you could say Mercury  That would give me a Y  Ooh  ' Very clever  that's a tough one  So I go Ytterbium  which gets you back to M  So you go Molybdenum  and I say Magnesium  you say Manganese  and I say Europium  and  and you're left with Mendelevium  and ' there are no more M's because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium  so congratulations  you win  Do you wanna go again ?
label1 All right  Hmm  huh  I'm sorry  I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling 
label1 Well  I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine  I'm not sure I'm capable of performing diagnostics 
label1 Okay  I'll give it a shot 
label1 Oh  Leonard  there you are  I'm ready to go home 
label1 Good  perfect timing 
label1 Penny  But I sense that's no longer an option 
label1 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ! Oh God  not Euclid Avenue ! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa !
label1 We had a difference of opinion 
label1 Whether or not he was trying to kill me  For the record  I maintain he was  Where are you going ?
label1 You want to go to pottery barn first ?
label1 Can you drive me to Pottery Barn ?
label1 Good morning 
label1 Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook ? But I don't have a problem 
label1 Why Penny ?
label1 Hold on  I have one condition 
label1 We have to stop at Pottery Barn 
label1 And Radio Shack 
label1 And the comic book store 
label1 I just don't see why I need a driver's license  Albert Einstein never had a driver's license 
label1 I was otherwise engaged 
label1 Examining perturbative amplitudes in n = 4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n = 8 supergravity using modern twistor theory 
label1 I'm actually more of a theorist 
label1 Excuse me  but I have some concerns about these questions 
label1 Just  look  see  this first question makes no sense  how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving ? There's no possible way to answer that  a car length is not a standardized unit of measure 
label1 No  no  wait  no  hang on  look at this next question 
label1 How else are they going to learn ? Look  question 2  when are roadways most slippery ? Now  okay  there are three answers  none of which are correct  The correct answer is  when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero  but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction 
label1 But I'm not done  I have many additional concerns about these questions 
label1 Aced it 
label1 Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah  behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee ?
label1 Statistically  red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour  I don't want any hassles with the fuzz 
label1 You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber  before it was digitally remastered ?
label1 I haven't fastened my seat belt yet 
label1 Click  Now  are there air bags ?
label1 Thank you 
label1 Sorry excuse me my bad student driver '
label1 I don't know  I was on the Pasadena freeway  I missed my exit  flew off the overpass  and one thing led to another 
label1 No  I quit 
label1 Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software  it's amazingly detailed 
label1 No  I'm not giving up  I never give up 
label1 Leonard  have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size ?
label1 Well  those are indicators that I'm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human 
label1 Well  no  no  I'm not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind  you know  a Homo Novus  if you will  no  that's for anthropologists to decide  But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I'm not meant to 
label1 No  no  Leonard  I'm meant for greater things  like unraveling the mysteries of the universe  not determining when it's safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road 
label1 Yeah  well  I know that now 
label1 Homo Novus doesn't know 
label1 Good morning  gentlemen 
label1 You saw nothing !
label1 In short  anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you  a cruel trick indeed  Any questions ? Of course not  I weep for the future of science  Now if you'll excuse me  the latest issue of Batman is out  Come  Leonard 
label1 The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it  But why should I cater to second-rate minds ?
label1 Oh  yeah ? Well you're a mean person 
label1 That is the prevailing opinion 
label1 Amazing  an intelligent labradoodle 
label1 I don't drink coffee 
label1 I do eat dinner 
label1 I never eat in strange restaurants  One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery 
label1 Three tines is not a fork  three tines is a trident  Forks are for eating  tridents are for ruling the seven seas 
label1 That would be acceptable  On Mondays  I eat Thai food  Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace 
label1 What a nice girl 
label1 Yes  Apparently I'm getting a free dinner 
label1 Oh  hello 
label1 Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself ?
label1 My hypotheses tend to have that effect 
label1 Not in these pants 
label1 Thank you  Did anyone touch it ?
label1 Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines 
label1 You don't tackle the big issues  Ramona  You fence with them  En garde  Riposte 
label1 Oh  good one 
label1 Well  to paraphrase Mozart  all the subatomic particles are there  I just have to put them in the right order 
label1 Aren't I ?
label1 Oh  yes  it's Halo night  Let me just dry my tootsies 
label1 Yes  I am  It's Wednesday  Wednesday's Halo night  </i>
label1 He did 
label1 Me  Sorry  Leonard 
label1 You heard her  How can I argue with me ?
label1 I prefer to think of it as I'm pulling them forward 
label1 He does on Wednesdays 
label1 He does want that  Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends ?
label1 I suppose  Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight 
label1 Please  please  I don't have a lot of time  Look  Ramona finally dozed off  and I need you to help me get rid of her 
label1 I don't know  but apparently I'm in some kind of relationship  and you seem to be an expert at ending them 
label1 I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return 
label1 Hide me 
label1 I formally request sanctuary 
label1 Um she distracted me  I told you  Penny  I don't have time for your nonsense  I have important things to do 
label1 It's Morse code 
label1 So we can communicate through the wall 
label1 Yes  but the communication is not encrypted 
label1 It's very simple  This is A
label1 Shh ! Ramona's sleeping on the couch 
label1 Never  that's the problem  I need your help 
label1 I'm invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement 
label1 Come on ! Don't nitpick !
label1 Shh  All right  I'm invoking our bodysnatchers clause 
label1 Yes  She's in the living room  Go  I'll wait here 
label1 And I could not have done it without you 
label1 It was a lot more than that  You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions  and you pumiced my hammer toe  How can I ever repay you ?
label1 Who's Nowitzki ?
label1 Oh  you want me to share credit ?
label1 Get out !
label1 Maybe when I publish it  I'll include an inhaler 
label1 Let's see  today's Thursday  Thursday nights  I eat pizza from Giacomo's  Sausage  mushrooms  light olives 
label1 What a nice girl 
label1 Yes  I'm getting a free pizza  I'm on a roll 
label1 More Pad Thai  please 
label1 Just one more bite 
label1 I'm just so full 
label1 Time  Alright Klingons  pencils down 
label1 eldon : Got it  Yup 
label1 eldon : Yeah  Yeah 
label1 Bilurrrbe 
label1 What's wrong with your TV ?
label1 Excuse me  Penny  but we're '
label1 All right  if you must watch  then mute it with closed captions  please 
label1 All right  Boggle warriors  kapla ' !
label1 Oh ! Worf  nice ! Too bad that's a proper noun 
label1 Is qochbe spelled with a ( gargling ) or a ( guttural grunt ) ?
label1 All right  pencils down ! I have lokh  makh  and cherrrkh  Anybody got those ?
label1 Is my hamburger medium well ?
label1 Dill slices  not sweet ?
label1 Individual relish packets ?
label1 Onion rings ?
label1 Extra breading ?
label1 What did they say ?
label1 Did you protest ?
label1 Vociferously ?
label1 Well  then what took you so long ?
label1 Oh  do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again ?
label1 You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise  Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting 
label1 Fine  Mock Parliamentary procedure  At least put it on mute 
label1 Who touched my '
label1 Well  I'm sorry  but that is your second strike 
label1 You have two strikes  Three strikes and you're out  It's a sports metaphor 
label1 Yes  baseball 
label1 March 18th  You violated my rule about forwarding email humour 
label1 The photo of the cat who wants to ' has cheezburger ' ?
label1 I trusted you with my email address  and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality  strike one  Touching my food  strike two 
label1 And then you put it back  compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings 
label1 Look  Penny  I wish I could be more lenient with you  but since you've become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else 
label1 Leonard  she's in my spot 
label1 All right  that's it  Strike three 
label1 Wait  Excuse me  You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger  barbecue sauce  bacon and cheese on the side 
label1 You can't do that  Not only is it a violation of California state law  it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Oh ! Hello 
label1 It's Saturday night  Saturday is laundry night 
label1 What are you implying ?
label1 No problem  I'll just do my laundry another night 
label1 Woman  you are playing with forces beyond your ken 
label1 Your clothes ?
label1 Really ? Despite the sign that says ' Do not leave laundry unattended ' ?
label1 You know  I do recall seeing some female undergarments  Where was that ? Oh  yes  earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye  Do those look familiar ?
label1 When you understand the laws of physics  Penny  anything is possible  And may I add  mwah-ha-ha !
label1 Well  then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata 
label1 I've done no stupid things 
label1 I am meeting you halfway  I'm willing to concede that you've done some stupid things 
label1 I had no choice  Leonard  she ruined laundry night 
label1 Mwah-ha-ha 
label1 Who is it ?
label1 Oh  good  Hi  Mom  How are you ? But  Mom  she keeps sitting in my spot  And  and she touched my food  Okay  yes  I took her clothes  but she started it  No  that's not fair  Why should I have to apologize ? Yeah  I really don't think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with  No  you're right  I don't really know what Jesus thinks about  All right  good-bye  Did you tell on me ?
label1 Well played 
label1 Just remember : with great power comes great responsibility 
label1 Oh look  Saturn 3 is on 
label1 How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3 ?
label1 In what sense is that a compromise ?
label1 It's very simple  Look  scissors cuts paper  Paper covers rock  Rock crushes lizard  Lizard poisons Spock  Spock smashes scissors  Scissors decapitates lizard  Lizard eats paper  Paper disproves Spock  Spock vaporizes rock  And as it always has  rock crushes scissors 
label1 Oh yes  like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters 
label1 I'm sorry  but I'm not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I've seen the Clone Wars movie  I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended 
label1 Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors - lizard-Spock moment 
label1 What did I do ?
label1 What happened ?
label1 Defcon 5 ? Well  there's no need to rush 
label1 Defcon 5 means no danger  Defcon 1 is a crisis 
label1 Okay  first of all  that's a comparison of quality  not intensity  Secondly  Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V 
label1 No  no  no  Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction  while Star Trek I fails across the board  art direction  costuming  music  sound editing 
label1 Where ?
label1 So what exactly do you want us to do ?
label1 Really ? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $ 200million government projects on distant planets ?
label1 Oh  how nice  Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison 
label1 I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion 
label1 Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive 
label1 Will you all excuse me ? Leonard is subtly signalling that he'd like to talk to me in private 
label1 Is there some problem ?
label1 Where are you going ?
label1 Who would ask me ?
label1 So you brought me in here to inform me that you can't tell me where you're going and you can't tell me who might ask ?
label1 Leonard  a moment 
label1 If someone  and of course  we don't know who this would be  does ask where you've gone  what should I say ?
label1 Are you going to the office ?
label1 All right  Leonard went to
label1 This would have worked out a lot better if you'd just told me you were going the office 
label1 See ? Why don't I believe you ?
label1 Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going ?
label1 Leonard is going to
label1 Okay  one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock 
label1 Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are  for all intents and purposes  deceased  He intends to act on this by not speaking to you  feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence 
label1 I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor  The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by 
label1 Look I'm sorry  you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence  I'm out 
label1 Penny  hello 
label1 What is shaking ?
label1 I'm striking up a casual conversation with you  S'u'up ?
label1 All right  But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone  it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat 
label1 Her name is Dr  Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial 
label1 Good  What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me 
label1 Yes  see  of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with  she's the only one I have ever found tolerable 
label1 Anyway  should you have any interaction with her  it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival 
label1 You say that now  but consider the following scenario  you're sitting in your apartment  it's late  you're alone  your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate  or a  uh  hookup as it's referred to by today's urban youth 
label1 Yes  Now  should that happen  I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido 
label1 Fine  whatever works 
label1 Well  this is very pleasant 
label1 And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Good  What's your favourite fruit ?
label1 Hmm  technically not a fruit  but all right  Where did you do your medical internship ?
label1 Really ? That's where I was born !
label1 I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital  When I was 12  I got to ride there in a helicopter 
label1 Radiation burns  A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner 
label1 Excuse me  When I come back  just for fun  the subject will be alternative history  Specifically  how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future ?
label1 I do  Do you ? Because frankly  you've been in a foul mood since I sat down 
label1 To help  Look  if you fail at this relationship  and history suggests you will  then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed 
label1 My apologies  you've been sitting in it all along  Leonard  you want to slide over one ?
label1 Oh  yeah  this is it 
label1 This is Stephanie's facebook page  Now  where it should say in a relationship  what does it say ?
label1 Yeah  furthermore  earlier this evening  she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike  Who's Mike ? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you ?
label1 You don't see it  do you ? We're losing her 
label1 I'm afraid I can't allow that  Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A  you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command 
label1 This is banana bread 
label1 It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat 
label1 I suppose I could spare a few minutes  Were you robbed ?
label1 How can you be sure ?
label1 I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you  but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship 
label1 She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet  If I have any hope of keeping them together  I need data  Specifically  I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks 
label1 Again  urban slang  In which  I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency  So  what is the down and the low ? And don't worry  this is all entirely confidential  so  you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom 
label1 Because ?
label1 It's not enough that you made me watch that movie  but now you mock me with it ?
label1 Gentlemen  I have a question about dating and relationships 
label1 More to the point  it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together 
label1 Well  why not ?
label1 Yes  I'm aware of the math  Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth  the issue remains  how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection ?
label1 So  that's all you've got ? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne ?
label1 I see  Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line  I apologize 
label1 So  have you and I returned to a social equilibrium ?
label1 I've been doing some research online  and apparently female primates  you know  uh  apes  chimpanzees  you  they find their mate more desirable when he's being courted by another female  Now  this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation  Which brings me back to my question  where are you in
label1 Oh  hi Stephanie 
label1 I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied 
label1 When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male  You see  when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin  If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love 
label1 Go ahead  it's pre-loosened 
label1 No  yeah  yeah  he's got it  and that's not surprising  This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male  Open it 
label1 FYI  I was defrosting a steak in there 
label1 Just for the record  my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears 
label1 Watery ?
label1 She's right  as long as you're vomiting  coitus is contra-indicated 
label1 You're welcome  Dr  Hofstadter 
label1 Well  you seem like a perfectly pleasant person  I just can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you 
label1 I had no choice  he cried in front of her 
label1 Oh  it's hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything  Kal-el 
label1 In which I am not an expert 
label1 Is it a high-frequency whistle ?
label1 Then it must be a tumour 
label1 Is that possible ? I used to get those all the time  Even in church 
label1 It's not enough that she mocks me  but that isn't even the correct procedure for a cootie shot 
label1 Leonard  there's one more thing  Under Article One  Section Three of our Roommate Agreement  I'm calling an emergency meeting 
label1 That being said  we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon ' cohabitation rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together 
label1 I beg to disagree  ' A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A  ten consecutive nights or B  more than nine nights in three week period or C : all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights 
label1 Hmm  yes  you did  Now  to review the following provisions are hereby activated  In the refrigerator  as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf  the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal  Next  apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells  Third  the bathroom schedule  Now  I'm given to understand women have different needs  so  we'll have to discuss that 
label1 At least take this with you  Look  and have Stephanie initial here  here  here  here and here  This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument  Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve 
label1 Good morning  Dr  Stephanie  I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night 
label1 I heard you ask it over and over  How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once ?
label1 See ? She's not offended  And now you finally have an answer 
label1 In Leonard's defence  it wasn't for lack of trying 
label1 Really ? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs  Vartabedian 
label1 What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs  Vartabedian ?
label1 Like hippies 
label1 Do I have to pull out the paperwork again ?
label1 Hang on  130 over 80  A little high  We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk 
label1 My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday  She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on  And by the way  the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer 
label1 Didn't they teach you that in medical school ?
label1 I understand  All I need is for you to authorize these tests 
label1 Oh  and an exploratory laparoscopy  Last time I had hiccups  it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions 
label1 Can I at least have the upper GI ? I already drank the barium !
label1 Wha ? ?
label1 I knew it ! What do I do ?
label1 For how '
label1 Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit  It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth's yellow sun  which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh 
label1 Like what ?
label1 I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded 
label1 Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle 
label1 It is a big whoop  It made almost all the work you've done since you've been here completely useless 
label1 It's a rhetorical question  There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night 
label1 Nice motivational speech from the team captain 
label1 In the pre-Christian era  as the winter solstice approached and the plants died  pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic  intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring  This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree 
label1 Wait ! You bought me a present ?
label1 Why would you do such a thing ?
label1 Of course I do  The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me  It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year 
label1 No  it's too late  I see it  That elf sticker says to Sheldon  The die has been cast  the moving finger has writ  Hannibal has crossed the Alps 
label1 No  No  I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life  I'm going to need a ride to the mall 
label1 That presupposes Penny is tense 
label1 No  we're not  Let's say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis  I now lay the following conundrum at your feet  which size ?
label1 You put no thought into that 
label1 If I were to give you this gift basket  based on that action alone and no other data  infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us 
label1 Here  Now  are we friends ? Colleagues ? Lovers ? Are you my grandmother ?
label1 You see  the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate  but I have devised a foolproof plan  See  I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself  feigning digestive distress 
label1 It is  isn't it ? Is it okay if I hide them in your room ? The smell makes me nauseated 
label1 Thank you  that's very gracious  ' ' ' Gentlemen 
label1 I should note I'm having some digestive distress  so  if I excuse myself abruptly  don't be alarmed  Oh  a napkin 
label1 To Sheldon  live long and prosper  Leonard Nimoy 
label1 I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy ? !
label1 Do you realize what this means ? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy !
label1 I know ! It's not enough  is it ? Here 
label1 Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot ?
label1 Did it when I was four  It's an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water 
label1 What did the toaster oven ever do to you ?
label1 Yeah  this is an auspicious moment  Yeah  like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong  we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event 
label1 I'm sorry  are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational ?
label1 His name is Monte 
label1 Leonard  I believe it is  This is trash talk  and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events  Kripke  your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution  Also  I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight 
label1 Now  of course  if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony  I withdraw that comment 
label1 There are boundaries 
label1 What do you mean ?
label1 Make it so 
label1 You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we're up against and we can modify Monte so that he's prepared 
label1 Have faith  gentlemen  We don't need Wolowitz  engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics  Watch and learn  Do either of you know how to open the toolbox ?
label1 No  Leonard  For years  merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns  That stops now 
label1 What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw  overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power 
label1 Trust me  Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare  Observe  Kripke ! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker  but as you are its maker  clearly the two of you have met 
label1 He's right  Leonard  The paradigm is to the death 
label1 Never  I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands 
label1 Indeed  We are prepared for anything he can throw at us 
label1 Don't hurt us  don't hurt us 
label1 I did this  Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride  No matter what anybody says  this is my fault 
label1 So what do you think  Howard ? It's not that bad  right ?
label1 You're right  Monte's gone  We'll bury him in the morning  A simple ceremony  I'll speak  Leonard  you'll play your cello 
label1 Just a toy robot ?
label1 It is extracted from the plant '
label1 Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta  Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly 
label1 It is also indigenous to Brazil  as is the Cocoa Bean  from which we get chocolate  the best pudding  And you promised you wouldn't do that anymore !
label1 Hey it's true  Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted  but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe 
label1 Well then  the solution is simple  I shall befriend him  Kripke !
label1 What'd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends ?
label1 Really ? That seems rather short sighted  coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable  Why don't you take some time to reconsider ?
label1 Well I think we're off to a terrific start 
label1 First warning 
label1 It's a questionnaire I devised  I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work  so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me 
label1 Yeah  I agree  the social sciences are largely hokum  But  short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship  this is the best I can do 
label1 I know  I may have started off with a fairly obvious one  You did an aspect of my most appealing trait  playfulness  Why don't you just go ahead and write that number 1  I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest  It should take you no more than 3 hours 
label1 Only 211  Don't worry  in deference to you  I've kept them on a high school graduate reading level 
label1 You got it  buddy 
label1 Well that's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis  May I suggest it as the topic for your essay 
label1 Your questionnaire  very disappointing 
label1 How could I not ?
label1 There are a number of acceptable answers  for example  C : near earth transport  but certainly not B : avocado rancher  And your essay  suggesting that I'd have better luck making friends if I wait ' til the Cylons take over ? Please 
label1 I don't see how you could 
label1 What do you mean ! ?
label1 I did learn how to swim 
label1 The ice caps are melting Leonard  In the future  swimming isn't going to be optional  But you do bring up an interesting point  I don't have to break new ground here  I'm sure much of the research already exists 
label1 That's insane on the face of it  Come on 
label1 You're driving me to the mall  I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking 
label1 Coping with the death of a loved one  My condolences 
label1 Family or friend ?
label1 Too bad  If it'd been a friend  I'm available to fill the void 
label1 Excuse me  Do you have any books about making friends ?
label1 I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred 
label1 Oh ! I love trains !
label1 Me too ! Most people don't see it  What are you reading ?
label1 Oh I do like monkeys !
label1 Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes  Say  maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together  Would you like that ?
label1 I'm making friends with this little girl  What's your name ?
label1 Hi Rebecca  I'm your new friend  Sheldon 
label1 We were really hitting it off 
label1 Oh good ! You're just in time  I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends 
label1 Mmhmm  Mmhmm  It's interesting  But isn't ventriloquism  by definition  a solo activity ? Yeah ? Tell me another interest of yours  Hmmm  Is there any chance you like monkeys ? What is wrong with you ? Everybody likes monkeys  Hang on  Kripke 
label1 You know  I am a fan of ventriloquism  Maybe you  me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage  He could talk while you drink 
label1 Hardly  Fear of heights is illogical  Fear of falling  on the other hand  is prudent and evolutionary  What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship ?
label1 Little kid Hominids  perhaps 
label1 Coming  Kripke  Okay  Harness seems to be secure  Small amount of incontinence just now  but the website said that's to be expected  Hey  this isn't so bad  A bit like vertical swimming 
label1 I am ? I was wrong  It IS a fear of heights 
label1 Not really  I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that's approaching an asymptote 
label1 What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand ?
label1 Yeah  I don't think I can 
label1 Well  it's not exactly a plan but I think I'm going to pass out 
label1 Hello  everyone  I brought my new friend  Barry Kripke  home for dinner 
label1 D-d-d ! That's where I sit 
label1 Oh yes  I pass out all the time  But  it was worth it  I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke  which brings me to an awkward moment 
label1 Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task  So  I'm going to have to let one of you go 
label1 Leonard  you are my roommate  my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer  You are safe 
label1 Don't be silly  Howard  you do not have a PhD  your cologne is an assault on the senses and you're not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays 
label1 No  You  too  are safe 
label1 Penny  Penny  Penny  Everything you're saying is true  but please allow me to continue  Raj  you're out  The good question  while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group  your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing  How could you  for a moment  think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine ?
label1 Yeah  Shoulda  woulda coulda  Raj 
label1 So uh  Kripke  I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer 
label1 No ? But we're friends !
label1 I'm confused  I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine ?
label1 The problem appears to be unsolvable 
label1 Right  these theatres have to be eliminated 
label1 They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines  No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that 
label1 Unacceptable  the delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work 
label1 Excuse me  in what universe are Slurpies Icees ?
label1 Oh  Leonard  you know I can't do that 
label1 He went to the movies without me  It was the only option  I'm sorry  I don't understand which social situation this is  Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed ?
label1 If you recall  I pointed out the ' check engine light to you several months ago 
label1 You know  it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money 
label1 Hang on a moment 
label1 That's why it's guarded by snakes  Take some 
label1 I'm never silly  Here 
label1 Don't you need money ?
label1 My expenses account for 469 % of my after-tax income  The rest is divvied up between a small savings account  this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection  Or her own protection  Take some 
label1 I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine 
label1 I sincerely hope so 
label1 Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water ?
label1 Of course you will  It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can  Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality 
label1 You know  I've given the matter some thought  and I think I'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens 
label1 Ask me why 
label1 Of course  That's how you move a conversation forward 
label1 The learning opportunities would be abundant  Additionally  I like having my belly scratched 
label1 Was that sarcasm ?
label1 Was that sarcasm ?
label1 Was that sarca 
label1 Penny  you appear to have a package here 
label1 Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms ? Another fascinating example is the epaulet 
label1 Oh  good  that was an unusual interaction  I wasn't sure 
label1 Forgive me  Penny  but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit 
label1 In case either of you have larceny in your heart  you should know that I've moved my money out of the snake can 
label1 Outside ? I just made cocoa 
label1 Leonard  do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman  we returned home without pants ?
label1 They did 
label1 They had a terrible time of it  Leonard 
label1 Which means his triumph will be even larger  Minstrels will write songs about him 
label1 You don't remember me ? How could he not remember me ?
label1 I remember him 
label1 I've got it  He didn't remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume 
label1 Congratulations  You may not have succeeded in getting cash  but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt 
label1 Hello  Penny 
label1 Darn  I can't seem to get the hang of that 
label1 Well done  Leonard  The true hero doesn't seek adulation  he fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature 
label1 This should be fairly easy to deduce  He's holding the phone to his left ear  Ears do not cross hemispheres  so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain  suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller 
label1 He's referring to an activity he has done before  It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated  This suggests some sort of invasive medical test  like perhaps a colonoscopy 
label1 I have the same problem with him  My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive 
label1 Of course  I would very much like to read about your sex life 
label1 The frequency with which your parents had intercourse 
label1 What a remarkable woman 
label1 I envy you your childhood 
label1 You're clearly misremembering  Your mother is brilliant  analytical  insightful  and I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts 
label1 You were lucky  When I was a kid  if I wanted an EEG  I had to attach my own electrodes 
label1 Leonard  I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you 
label1 Her reasoning is unassailable  It is one o'clock 
label1 You went to the comic book store without me  7
label1 I know  Although I've always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures 
label1 I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime 
label1 Oh  I can't believe that 
label1 My apologies  I've been living with your son too long  Gotten into some bad habits 
label1 I feel very comfortable around you 
label1 It's surprising because I generally don't feel comfortable around  well  anyone 
label1 What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son ?
label1 I'd like to do the math 
label1 So  what do you think ?
label1 Normally  I'd feel the same way  But based on everything I've observed about us  I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together 
label1 You see right through me  don't you ?
label1 The Pharmacology Department controls that  and they're all hopped up on experimental steroids 
label1 I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting 
label1 And I told you I wanted to see a doctor's note 
label1 Because you chose your mother's veins over victory  On three  One  two  three  go !
label1 Based on your academic record  any number of things  I would imagine 
label1 I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action 
label1 The mrow  that sounded to me like an African civet cat 
label1 Is that why you didn't cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals ?
label1 My good man  dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense 
label1 Hello  Penny 
label1 You're in my spot 
label1 No  I'm going to the comic book store 
label1 What difference does it make ?
label1 That is my spot  In an ever-changing world  it is a single point of consistency  If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system  that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero 
label1 Fine  The new issue of Flash is out 
label1 Koothrappali picked me up 
label1 They don't talk incessantly for no particular reason 
label1 Hello  fastest man alive  Want to see me read your entire comic book ? Want to see it again ? Something's wrong 
label1 I'm not sure  It doesn't feel right 
label1 Why don't I just eat in my desk chair ?
label1 That is my desk chair  that is where I work  I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot  I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot 
label1 You claim it's going to be a week  but I have no faith in your dry cleaner 
label1 Focus is important  Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants ? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser ? ' Thanks for discovering penicillin  now how about we try a bouffant ? '
label1 This is my spot  Where else am I supposed to crouch ?
label1 From that key maker  I highly doubt it 
label1 Yes  From Szechuan Palace 
label1 What ? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from ?
label1 No  No  this isn't right  Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers 
label1 But  Oh  this changes everything 
label1 What's real ? What isn't ? How can I know ?
label1 Leonard ?
label1 I still don't like this cushion 
label1 That was for my cushion 
label1 I'm sorry  Leonard  But revenge is a dish best served cold 
label1 She can't shoot me  She's dead 
label1 Well  if we're going to descend into anarchy
label1 But once you open the box  you've voided the warranty  The warranty is a sacred covenant we've entered into with the manufacturer  He offers to stand by his equipment  and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware  This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy 
label1 I understand your envy  This is a can't-miss symposium  There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices  the advancements in multi-threaded task completion  plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green's function approach to the photoionization process in atoms 
label1 George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist  one of the great minds of our time  His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe 
label1 It's like talking to a chimp 
label1 We're not flying  we're taking the train 
label1 Don't say it like that  Leonard  say it like : we're taking the train !
label1 Oh  I always enjoy that  but I'm a little busy 
label1 I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip  See  by attaching RFID tags to my clothing  it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand  I will then cross-reference them against destination  anticipated activity spectrum  weather conditions  duration of trip  et cetera 
label1 Assuming I can keep up this pace  three hours  11 minutes  and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation 
label1 I don't follow 
label1 Socks  one pair  cotton  argyle  blue  Socks  one pair  cotton  argyle  blue 
label1 What on earth are you doing ?
label1 Gentlemen  this is the Coast Starlight  one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes  On this side  you'll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation  while on your side  you'll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos  Jiffy Lubes  and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools 
label1 That's over the wheelbase  Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre - 1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach ?
label1 Here  I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails  your sour disposition will abate 
label1 He is referring  of course  to third class on Indian Railways magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction 
label1 Of course  if SkyNet actually did exist in the future  a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series  lulling us into a false sense of security  i  e   that's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles  No  Summer  don't kill me ! I'm pro-robot ! Ahh !
label1 I'm confused  I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle 
label1 All right 
label1 and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you're going as far as Portland 
label1 You don't understand  My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference 
label1 It's brilliant  He needs to read it 
label1 Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it 
label1 Oh  this is an unmitigated disaster 
label1 You forgot your flash drive  You forgot your flash drive
label1 Okay  I've found the perfect solution  We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard  We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station  We take a cab back to the apartment  get my flash drive  and then race to San Luis Obispo  where  assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic  we'll meet the train 
label1 Are you going to be sarcastic ?
label1 But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk 
label1 The key is hidden in my room 
label1 Penny would have to go into my room 
label1 People don't go in my room !
label1 Oh  I hate when that happens 
label1 It's Sheldon 
label1 I'm not in San Francisco  I'm on a train  Were you even listening to me ?
label1 What's up ? I'll tell you what's up  I'm in a crisis situation  and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration  limited as they may be '
label1 Okay  Enough chitchat  Okay  step one  locate your emergency key to our apartment  Step two  enter our apartment  Step three  enter my bedroom 
label1 Yes  I'm still here  Where am I going ? I'm on a train  Now  what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite  Hoberman's Sphere  It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron  No  the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock 
label1 That's the wrong box  Put it back 
label1 Don't read those letters !
label1 Put down the letters !
label1 I'm back 
label1 Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw !
label1 You're holding a Japanese puzzle box  which takes ten precise moves to open  First  locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left  Then  on the opposite end of the box  slide the entire panel down two millimetres  You'll hear a slight click 
label1 No  it's a novelty I ordered off the Internet  Now  did you hear the click ?
label1 Okay  now you're going to insert the flash drive into the USB port  She calls me Moon Pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up  now  please put the flash drive in the USB port  The one that looks like a little duck's mouth 
label1 So  I'm thinking  you won the Nobel Prize what  three years ago ? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately ? My thought is we continue my research as a team  you know  Cooper-Smoot  alphabetical  and when we win the Nobel Prize  you'll be back on top 
label1 Despite my deep love of chess  lasers and aerosol disinfectant  I must forfeit 
label1 Because it's almost eleven o'clock 
label1 So  Penny has a don't knock on my door before eleven o'clock or I punch you in the throat rule 
label1 It's eleven am 
label1 This package came while you were at work 
label1 You have to sign this 
label1 Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property  or chattels  is transferred from one person  the bailor  to another person  the bailee 
label1 Obviously  not a cleaning business 
label1 But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights ?
label1 And you're going to let her handle my food ?
label1 Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy 
label1 How many of these can you make a day ?
label1 And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom ?
label1 No  Of course you're not  All right  ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars 
label1 Before taxes 
label1 I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree  But  if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques  and you optimized your manufacturing process  you might be able to make this a viable business 
label1 I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe  Good luck 
label1 Just to be clear here  you're asking for my assistance 
label1 And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do ?
label1 And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I'm doing so 
label1 Good  Let's begin with the premise that everything you've done up to this point is wrong 
label1 Sarcasm  Good-bye 
label1 All right  12 minutes and 17 seconds 
label1 That's 49 Penny Blossoms per hour  Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price  you'll effectively be paying yourself $ 519 a day 
label1 You're questioning my math ?
label1 Want me to show my work ?
label1 All right  are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honor Blanc's 1778 use of interchangeable parts ? The assembly line  of course 
label1 That wasn't a part of our original agreement  and I do not agree to it now 
label1 You're thinking of the moving assembly line  an understandable but not excusable mistake  No  The moving assembly line  that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908  That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods  I guess that isn't one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead 
label1 I assume you're referring to the sea shanty  It's a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity 
label1 Penny's making hair accessories  I'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process  All right  break's over 
label1 Hot glue 
label1 It won't work  the flower's too porous 
label1 Intriguing 
label1 Hush  hush  hush  hush  hush  virtually non-existent  I'm thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start 
label1 Of course  but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure  we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process  To start with  she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump 
label1 Let's think out of the box for a moment  How about a molecular sieve ?
label1 Oh  great  Raj  why don't you and Howard go get the charcoal ? Leonard  why don't you start working on some preliminary Web site designs  I'll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process 
label1 It's not my apartment 
label1 Penny  this is your enterprise  so it's ultimately your decision  but based on the quality of his work  I'd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go 
label1 What I want is irrelevant  This is Penny's decision  Penny ?
label1 Camouflaging bald spots  That's primarily a male concern  Perhaps we could expand our market 
label1 Brilliant  Men love Bluetooth 
label1 Penny  everything is better with Bluetooth 
label1 Oh  another market to expand into  balding gay men 
label1 We should get to work 
label1 Excuse me  but was this not your goal ? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation ? My brilliance and innovation  of course  but still 
label1 Okay  that  right there  that equivocation and self-doubt  that is not the American spirit  Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo ? Did Jim Bowie ?
label1 I believe I'm hearing some negativity on the factory floor 
label1 Penny  the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured  Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management  Observe  Hey ! Less talk  more work !
label1 Thank you  You hear any union talk  you let me know 
label1 No  I don't drink coffee 
label1 I'm sorry  coffee's out of the question  When I moved to California  I promised my mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs 
label1 I have complete faith that you will make them  Good night 
label1 You're right  of course 
label1 Look at Planck's Constant  People say it's arbitrary  It could not be less arbitrary  If it varied even slightly  life as we know it would not exist  Bam ! Now  now  let's reconsider the entire argument  but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause  so you are thinking of a universe that's not expanding from the centre  no  it is retreating from a  from a possibility space  Bam ! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass  standing in front the Red Queen  and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst  Bam ! Of course  in another universe  let's call it universe prime  there's another Sheldon  let's call him Sheldon prime '
label1 No problem  I'll be back before this banana hits the ground  Zoom  zoom  zoom  zoom ! Zoom  zoom  zoom  zoom !
label1 Penny  please  we're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids 
label1 Not bad ? It's horrible  I mean  you hear stories about this sort of thing  but you never think it'll happen to you 
label1 The horror !
label1 The horror !
label1 No  it's not going to be fine  change is never fine  They say it is  but it's not 
label1 I never met them  That's what made them perfect  there were no awkward hellos in the halls  there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors  they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell 
label1 You can't know that  How can you possibly know that ?
label1 Hold on  You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move  and then he only need buy us a pizza ?
label1 I knew it ! PS3  definitely PS3  who would pick a mountain bike ?
label1 Oh  no  the new ones  they're here 
label1 If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate  hello 
label1 Hello  On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline ?
label1 Is that your answer or do you not understand the question ? We'll come back to that one 
label1 Hang on  Are you now or have you ever been a salsa  Irish folk or break-dancer ?
label1 Oh  I'm sorry  Well  if it helps you feel any better you're doing very well so far  Next question  are you fertile ?
label1 I'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility 
label1 Welcome to the building 
label1 You don't jog 
label1 True  but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you're out of clean clothes again 
label1 You're welcome  Penny 
label1 Oh  mimicry  I enjoy mimicry  I've been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi  ' It's a trap  You have to imagine me with a giant squid head  ' It's a trap  It's a trap  It's a trap  '
label1 Congratulations  I see you did your laundry 
label1 He's upstairs at Alicia's 
label1 It's axiomatically atypical  Up until recently  they did not know Alicia  and had no encounters with her in a previous location  They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants  so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious 
label1 Oh  great ! now  I have to start all over again 
label1 You think I can't hear them ? Listen to that  Stomp  stomp  stomp  That's Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one 
label1 You know  Penny  there's something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting  Occasionally  a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power  When this happens  the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains 
label1 I'm just talking about bees  They're on the discovery channel  What are you talking about ?
label1 Even though the menu description specifies shredded ?
label1 Brown rice  not white ?
label1 You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard ?
label1 Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market ?
label1 Good  See how it's done  Leonard ?
label1 They're gone  Penny  They can't hear you 
label1 You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend 
label1 May I interject something here ?
label1 You got the wrong mustard 
label1 Hu-u-u-uh '  Hu-u-u-uh !
label1 This is Thai food 
label1 We don't have Thai food on Thursday  We have pizza on Thursday 
label1 Well apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system  which  when startled  has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday 
label1 Rut ? I think you mean consistency  And if we're going to abandon that  then why even call it Thursday ? Let's call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece  and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra 
label1 All right  Let's go to the comic book store 
label1 Last night was Wednesday  Wednesday is comic book night  Tonight  we'll be going on Thursday  because it's Anything Can Happen Thursday 
label1 The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets  and those planets likely to develop life ? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L ?
label1 Fascinating 
label1 I think you mean comic books  Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages 
label1 Just pick out anything ? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size  or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude  or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows 
label1 Amazing Spider-Man  Ultimate Spider-Man  Spectacular Spider-Man  The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man  Spider-Man 2099 ?
label1 Get her out of here 
label1 Why should I let it go ? I saw it first 
label1 A far less impressive feat 
label1 I need it for my Robin collection 
label1 Why would I gamble ? It's mine  Let go 
label1 Yes  he won't let go of my comic book 
label1 Leonard  we need a ruling 
label1 So  Leonard  how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday ?
label1 Are you ill ?
label1 All right  Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening ?
label1 Then  this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section 
label1 Would you rather I offer my personal insight ?
label1 Oh  I disagree  Stuart is taller  artistic  self-employed and  most significantly  he gets 45 percent off comic books 
label1 My original point 
label1 Chinese food  vintage video games  After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday  this is Friday night the way it was meant to be 
label1 Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned  Tonight  we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure  Zork  It's the buggy beta version 
label1 Oh  good  Stuart  I thought I heard your voice  Do you have a moment ?
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 Isn't it a little late for coffee ?
label1 Well  I've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom  and I need your help 
label1 Has to be ? Has to be ? I hope you're being deliberately provocative 
label1 Yeah  herbal tea for me  please 
label1 Of course I am  Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman's parents effectively deprived him of his raison d''tre 
label1 Au contraire 
label1 I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone 
label1 So  I win 
label1 No  no  no  no  don't wake her  She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine 
label1 That's preposterous  I do not resemble C3PO  Don't get me wrong  I'm flattered  I just don't see it 
label1 What exactly does that expression mean  friends with benefits ? Does he provide her with health insurance ?
label1 I'm sorry  I can't imagine any of that 
label1 I don't like this game 
label1 I bet he's someone from Babylon 5  we're never going to guess 
label1 I don't understand  If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having ' what appears be an emotional response ?
label1 You know  I'm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems  Where you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism  gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases 
label1 Thank you  Hello  neighbour 
label1 And how are you doing this fine evening ?
label1 Good  I'm glad 
label1 I'm just in a good mood  While my compatriots are in Las Vegas  I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude 
label1 Do you know  I'm such a good mood  I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today 
label1 That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer  a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds  Not only is it Indian cuisine  which Koothrappali loathes  it contains a generous helping of peanuts  which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister  And finally  it's main ingredient is Paneer  a farmer's cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes 
label1 Penny  I realize you are also on your own tonight  so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do  please do not disturb me 
label1 Oh  I shall 
label1 I left them in the bowl 
label1 Where ?
label1 What's it doing in my apartment ?
label1 You were in my why would you what are you saying ?
label1 You're the milk thief ! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter 
label1 Eat ? My dinner ? In your apartment ?
label1 Sure  why not ? And after the sun's down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek  ' Cause today's the day to stop making sense 
label1 So  how was your day ?
label1 I'm sorry  that's not going to interest me at all  just eat 
label1 Okay  that's question 20  you have to guess 
label1 Fine  I was Spock  Are you and Leonard friends with benefits 
label1 Are you and Leonard friends with benefits ?
label1 No  Leonard said nothing  but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered 
label1 Hmm  I see 
label1 I'm curious about the whole social construct  On its face  the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite  assuming one is afflicted with such  without emotional entanglement  that seems eminently practical  What I've observed  however  is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl 
label1 Can you ?
label1 Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment ?
label1 Is this conversation making you uncomfortable ?
label1 Thank you  that's very helpful 
label1 Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch 
label1 I can't sleep on your couch  I sleep in a bed  And given it's dimensions I have no intention of living out E  M  Snickering's beloved children's book  The Tall Man From Cornwall 
label1 There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed  My body fits on it  but barely upon it  there's no room for my big Cornish head 
label1 May I say one last thing 
label1 I'm homesick 
label1 Twenty feet  twenty light years  it doesn't matter  It's in a galaxy far  far away 
label1 Sing soft kitty 
label1 Homesick is a type of being sick 
label1 I suppose we can stay up and talk 
label1 No  Start over 
label1 Thank you for letting me stay here 
label1 Okay  I'm sleepy now  get out 
label1 Oh  good  you're finally home 
label1 Smell that ? That's the smell of new comic books  Oh  yes !
label1 I believe it is  The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing 
label1 You told me it's mind-blowing  so  my mind is going into it pre-blown  And once a mind is pre-blown  it cannot be re-blown 
label1 Said the Grinch to Christmas 
label1 You're not going to answer it ?
label1 You're making an assumption  Perhaps the comic book store is on fire  and he needs your assistance 
label1 We don't know  And if you don't answer the phone  we can't know 
label1 Answer the phone  Leonard 
label1 At times 
label1 But the mission is for six months 
label1 Have you notified NASA ?
label1 For what it's worth  my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain  we make Jesus cry 
label1 All right  what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support ?
label1 It won't work  The diameter of the tubing is insufficient 
label1 It won't work  No way to mount it 
label1 That could work 
label1 You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building 
label1 If you knew what you were doing  there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be 
label1 Oh  an excellent idea ! I could certainly use a break 
label1 I must say  Howard  I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree 
label1 Fascinating 
label1 I don't see why I have to worry  My career's not hanging in the balance  That was a joke  It's funny  because it's true 
label1 Oh  boy 
label1 I can't comment without violating our agreement that I don't criticize your work 
label1 Great restraint on my part 
label1 Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science 
label1 You actually had it right in the first place  Once again  you've fallen for one of my classic pranks  Bazinga ! Well  now here's a peculiar e-mail  The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a  m 
label1 It doesn't say  It must be an emergency  Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8: 20 
label1 That's 14 hours away  For the next 840 minutes  I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles  I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going  but I can't know both  Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head ?
label1 He didn't respond to my e-mail  his phone number is unlisted  Tell me what my other option was 
label1 Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole ?
label1 Aw  how nice  Well  a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle 
label1 Yes  In fact  he was quite enthusiastic  He said  ' Frankly  if I could send you tonight  I would  '
label1 Of course not  I'm a theoretical physicist  a career I chose in no small part because it's indoors  but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there  I will be the scientist to confirm string theory  People will write books about me  Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life 
label1 Sarcasm ?
label1 I'm on the horns of a dilemma  Can you imagine me  Sheldon Cooper  at the North Pole ?
label1 I'm not good with cold  Leonard  How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast ? I can't go 
label1 How can you say that ? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don't go 
label1 Odd  President Seibert posed the exact same question 
label1 It wasn't  His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot 
label1 Good news  gentlemen  I have tentatively accepted '
label1 ' the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition 
label1 Thank you  but your sentiments may be premature 
label1 I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me 
label1 I'll admit that was a concern  But the fact is  I'll need a support team  And the three of you are my first choice 
label1 Well  gentlemen  have you reached a decision ?
label1 Excellent  And just an FYI  as I am the expedition's team leader  protocol dictates that be phrased fine  sir  But don't worry  there will be a briefing 
label1 I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer 
label1 Is that a yes or a no on the freezer ? The woman has the attention span of a gnat 
label1 Yes  yes  you were busy  you were surprised  all very fascinating  Now where do we stand on the freezer ?
label1 I'm sorry  but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action ?
label1 No  Did she seem upset to you ?
label1 That feels like a bonus question  I'm going to stop here while I'm ahead  but I've had a great time 
label1 Alright  now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle 
label1 And begin 
label1 Adversity is to be expected  Continue 
label1 Gentlemen  use your imagination  Innovate  Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth ? No  He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up 
label1 I hadn't thought of that  I guess we're done here 
label1 It's hot chocolate with a stick of butter 
label1 Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic  we need to consume at least 5000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight 
label1 I want a cookie  Meemaw 
label1 Comforting is a part of leadership  It's not a part I care for  but such is my burden 
label1 Assuming that's a valid reason not to go  which it isn't  how do you know this ? Did she say it ?
label1 What is it ?
label1 Oh  that's clever  Let me see if I understand this correctly  Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable ?
label1 All right  Well  given that missing you is predicated on you leaving  logic dictates you must leave 
label1 She does have a short attention span 
label1 Leonard  you may be right  It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion 
label1 Of course not  Even in my sleep-deprived state  I've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks  Bazinga !
label1 All right  men  we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours  but until then  you are all off duty  I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled 
label1 It is remarkable 
label1 What are we having ?
label1 Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce ?
label1 Freeze-dried spicy mustard ?
label1 Not to worry  I hid it  Bazinga ! You're in my spot 
label1 Three months  This is gonna be great !
label1 I don't know what Arctic expedition you guys were on  but I thought it was a hoot and a half 
label1 Oh  hi mom  No  I told you I'd call you when I got home  I'm not home yet 
label1 Mother  I have to go  Yeah  love you  Bye 
label1 I just want you both to know  when I publish my findings  I won't forget your contributions 
label1 Of course  I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech  but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote  and perhaps a signed copy 
label1 Tell me what ?
label1 You fellows are planning a party for me  aren't you ?
label1 If there's going to be a theme  I should let you know that I don't care for luau  toga or under the sea 
label1 If this is about the night the heat went out  there's nothing to be embarrassed about 
label1 So we slept together naked  It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting 
label1 Oh  yes  In the world of emoticons  I was colon  capital D 
label1 You tampered with my experiment ?
label1 Did Leonard know about this ? Leonard's my best friend in the world  Surely Leonard didn't know 
label1 Of course it was  The whole plan reeks of Leonard 
label1 Whispering do not make a sound is a sound 
label1 Hello  Penny  I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges  but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you  may I interrupt this one ?
label1 What's going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science  when in fact  I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz  Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy 
label1 That seems like a bit of an overreaction 
label1 You're right  Leonard  it's not a big deal  All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university  That  FYI  was sarcasm  I  in fact  believe it is a big deal
label1 About what ? Being betrayed by my friends ? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing ? And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con !
label1 That's for when I'm sick  Sad is not sick 
label1 Really ? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you ?
label1 Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize ?
label1 And on a different  but not unrelated topic  based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits  do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader ?
label1 I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie !
label1 Because I am without friends  Like the proverbial cheese  I stand alone  Even while seated 
label1 It's going to take more than I'm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done to me 
label1 You see ? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning 
label1 My credibility may have been damaged '
label1 Oh  you think you're so clever  Well  let me just tell you  while I do not currently have a scathing retort  you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy 
label1 Thanks  Mom 
label1 Aw  Mom 
label1 Grateful 
label1 Plateful 
label1 Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich 
label1 They're not my friends 
label1 What are they doing here ?
label1 Evolution isn't an opinion  it's fact 
label1 I forgive you  Let's go home 
label1 Howard  you know me to be a very smart man  Don't you think if I were wrong  I'd know it ?
label1 Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction 
label1 Oh  a clever  albeit obsolete  euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ 
label1 Excuse me  Wolverine : Origin  Miniseries issue two  page 22  Retractable bone claws  If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books  we'd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments 
label1 Tandoori Palace ?
label1 You're good-naturedly ribbing me  aren't you ?
label1 Why ? Why would we change ? We had a perfectly good palace  Tandoori Palace is our palace 
label1 If that's Morse code  that's terrible  As I was saying  you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter  Earlier this evening  Leonard characterized it as just fine  So what you're seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed 
label1 Hang on  Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room  it is a snowy tree cricket 
label1 Howard  don't embarrass yourself  the science chirps for itself  Humorous word play 
label1 I can't take your money 
label1 I've always found that an inappropriate slur  Chickens are not  by nature  at all timid  In fact  when I was young  my neighbour's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house 
label1 Thank God 
label1 Fair enough  What stake do you propose ?
label1 All right  you have a wager 
label1 I don't see anything 
label1 Help me open it 
label1 Fine  if you don't want to proceed  then you forfeit the bet  and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four 
label1 Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you ?
label1 Oh  really ? Well  I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation  be it noogies  swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself ?
label1 Uh-oh  flashlight went out  I need some batteries  Fellas ? Hello ? It's really dark down here 
label1 His name isn't Toby  Toby is an absurd name for a cricket 
label1 An appropriate cricket name  For example  Jiminy 
label1 Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess 
label1 Forgive me  Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas  And if it was  it wasn't spoken for long 
label1 We haven't established that I'm wrong once 
label1 He's a snowy tree cricket  and his name is Jiminy 
label1 Interesting  You're afraid of insects and women  Ladybugs must render you catatonic  It was a joke  I made it to lessen your discomfort  You're welcome
label1 Excuse me  are you Professor Crawley ?
label1 I'm Dr  Cooper from the Physics Department 
label1 I'm sorry ?
label1 No  no  We're here  let's settle this  Professor  can you identify our cricket ?
label1 Told you 
label1 No  no  wait  Dr  Crawley  are you sure ?
label1 Cruel as that may be  that is not in itself a credential 
label1 Old comic books  I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager 
label1 Penny  I'd rather not talk about it 
label1 Yes  yes  the disappointing sex  That's an inexact parallel  You and Leonard can always return to being friends  whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs  Riley's chicken 
label1 A chicken that was owned by Mrs  Riley 
label1 Well  I wish I could 
label1 Of course I'm right What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week ?
label1 Leonard  it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial  I lost a bet to Wolowitz 
label1 Hardly 
label1 Have I crossed some sort of line again ?
label1 Hmm  Oh  who cares ?
label1 Penny  while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes  I assure you that in none of them am I dancing 
label1 The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy  But I don't dance 
label1 It's Oatmeal Day 
label1 Dear Lord  are you still going to be here on French Toast Day ?
label1 Look  Leonard  Penny made French toast 
label1 It's an iCal download  she can put it right in her phone  And I thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment 
label1 I want oatmeal 
label1 I'm sure that will happen soon enough  But in the meantime  I still want oatmeal 
label1 I can't be impossible  I exist  I believe what you meant to say is  ' I give up  he's improbable  '
label1 What am I supposed to do  eat French toast on a Monday ? Now  that would be impossible 
label1 You can catch even more flies with manure  What's your point ?
label1 Boy  that does smell good  Too bad it's Monday 
label1 Easily calculable  we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names  We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work  the aged  the imprisoned and the limbless  for example  Next we look at '
label1 There are more things in heaven and earth  Horatio  than are dreamt of in your philosophy 
label1 Did you ? I didn't notice  Have a chocolate 
label1 And it's not a cartoon  it's anime 
label1 You're here a lot now 
label1 Really ?
label1 Very good  Chocolate ?
label1 There's just no pleasing you  is there  Leonard ? You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her  so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques  building on the work of Thorndike and B  F  Skinner  By this time next week  I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool  balancing a beach ball on her nose 
label1 I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool  I thought the ' bazinga was implied  I'm just tweaking her personality  sanding off the rough edges if you will 
label1 Are you saying that I'm forbidden from applying a harmless  scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better ?
label1 If you let me use negative reinforcement  I can get it done before we go to bed 
label1 No  of course not  We're talking very mild electric shocks  No tissue damage whatsoever 
label1 Oh  come on  you can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend 
label1 You mean  like that high-pitched  irritating laugh ?
label1 No  that would be incongruous  I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register 
label1 Come again ?
label1 Well  I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in  I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites  you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum 
label1 Interesting  Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour  I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that 
label1 This movie baffles me every time we watch it 
label1 Well  the instructions are very clear  don't feed the gremlins after midnight  don't get the gremlins wet  How hard is that ?
label1 Yes  Since their relationship became carnal  Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment  thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie  usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult 
label1 The parade 
label1 You guess ? You don't seem to have much of a handle on this 
label1 I believe it means that the U  S  Government is going to expel him from the country  He could then either return to his native India  emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him  or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate  Personally  I'd choose pirate 
label1 Another reason to consider a life of piracy  Even today  I understand that's an all-male profession 
label1 And you've continued to take the university's money under false pretences ? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist  Although practically mandatory for a pirate 
label1 Hi  Leonard  Hello  Raj 
label1 I was going to say sad  I don't know why I hedged 
label1 Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce 
label1 I'm sorry 
label1 Understandable  Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you  and your future appears bleak at best 
label1 And you're wrong about Hinduism and cows 
label1 That's happy  right ?
label1 Nailed it 
label1 Raj  did you get the job with Professor Laughlin ?
label1 I assumed as much  But never fear  Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel  I have returned to save the day  Odd  usually  he's met by cheers  Anyway  I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations  and it occurred to me that I could benefit '
label1 For me  You're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job 
label1 For me 
label1 For me 
label1 I'm impressed  Raj  Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions 
label1 I'm sorry  I believe you've misunderstood  I'm not giving you the job  I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it  Have a seat  we'll get started with the interview 
label1 Please 
label1 So  that's what you wear to an interview ?
label1 Oh  pulling strings  are we ?
label1 Bazinga ! You've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes  I'm your boss now  You may want to laugh at that 
label1 All right  we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space 
label1 I'm the boss  I make the jokes 
label1 This is not the time for joking  We're doing serious research  which requires complete and utter focus 
label1 Top desk drawer 
label1 Of course I understand  And who are you to tell me about outer space ?
label1 Astro means star 
label1 English is your native language 
label1 There is a fine line between wrong and visionary  Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it 
label1 All right ! First of all  Dr  Koothrappali  when I first proposed that you work with me '
label1 In this context  with me means for me 
label1 Oh ! If I'm wrong  prove it 
label1 You're defacing my work 
label1 Give me the eraser 
label1 I am in every way 
label1 Doing what ?
label1 I looked over the board and it turns out you were right 
label1 I didn't say that 
label1 Nevertheless  I didn't say it  Anyway  I would like you to come back and work for me 
label1 In this context for me could mean with me 
label1 I reject them all 
label1 Wait  you have to drive me home 
label1 I walked 
label1 I can't  There's a big dog outside  On the way home  we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles 
label1 It doesn't matter  You can't possibly win 
label1 Given the cards that have already been played  Penny can only be holding necromancer potions  which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers  and there are no more of either left to be drawn  The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons  a troll  two ogres and the jewel of Osiris 
label1 From your vantage point  it certainly must seem so 
label1 Photographic is a misnomer  I have an eidetic memory  as I've told you many times  Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh  You had turkey and complained it was dry 
label1 June 30th  2004  Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena  They only had red icees  no blue 
label1 You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination 
label1 I'm sorry  no 
label1 Yes  I've moved to a four-napkin system  Lap  hands  face and personal emergencies  If you like  starting tomorrow  I'll add a guest napkin  but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today 
label1 I'd imagine you heard any number of things today  When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard  hello  Raj  how are you  Raj ? Given that you're wearing a new sweater-vest  you may have heard new sweater-vest ? And possibly  though far less likely  nice sweater-vest 
label1 That would probably save us some time 
label1 I'm sorry  Raj  but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge 
label1 I have money 
label1 How does it different from the money I have ?
label1 Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest ?
label1 Got it  Got it  Got it  Got it  Got it  Got it  Betty and Veronica ? Ugh 
label1 Thank you  You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession 
label1 But I must have it 
label1 Thank you  You know  I can buy all these things online  I come here for the personal service 
label1 You don't understand  Growing up  I idolized Wil Wheaton ? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me 
label1 I was such a fan that in 1995  I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson  Mississippi  wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure 
label1 My arduous journey  however  was for naught  Although advertised to appear  he did not show up  It was at that moment  I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton 
label1 It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list  right between director Joel Schumacher  who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise  and Billy Sparks  who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle 
label1 In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan  he tasks me  he tasks me and I shall have him 
label1 From hell's heart  I stab at thee 
label1 My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace  Game 
label1 Look at him  Wil Wheaton  my old friend  I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames !
label1 Silence ! How much longer must I wait for my revenge ?
label1 So  my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants  Very well  They must be destroyed 
label1 Silence !
label1 I play my endless serpent  Raj will play ecstatic frenzy  which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord  then Captain Sweatpants  molten river  I play nightshade dryad  game  set and match  Now fetch me Wil Wheaton ! bortaS bIr jablu'DI reH QaQqu nay '
label1 Underworld guardian  We skirmish to the death 
label1 Luminescence spell 
label1 Fire demon 
label1 The year was 1995  the place  Jackson  Mississippi  Having spent ten hours on a bus  during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle  I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure 
label1 You betrayed me  Wil Wheaton  Now I have my revenge 
label1 Your mee-maw died ? That's terrible 
label1 Oh  yes 
label1 I can't 
label1 No  I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton  the man who destroyed my dreams  But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton  the man who loved his mee-maw  Enchanted bunny 
label1 I I I don't understand  Your grandmother's alive ?
label1 Excuse me  You're misusing the word ho  It's an interjection used to call attention to a destination  not an object  as in  uh  Land  ho ! Or  uh  Westward  ho !
label1 I'm sorry  I got bored and drifted off  Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie ?
label1 Oh  that certainly would suck 
label1 Wolowitz is trying to outflank us  Let out some string  add altitude and I'll go under and cut his line 
label1 You're embarrassing me right now  a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites 
label1 Victory !
label1 Well  her actions could be out of concern for your feelings  Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings because she's scouting for a new mate and doesn't want to do it in front of you 
label1 Agreed  Most primates don't show that sort of discretion  A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do ?
label1 I'm sorry  Raj  but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor  And without rules  the competition has no meaning  And without meaning  the following would be an empty gesture 
label1 It's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage 
label1 The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence 
label1 I grew up in Texas  Football is ubiquitous in Texas  Pro football  college football  high school football  peewee football  in fact  every form of football except the original  European football  which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot 
label1 If you're interested  I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken 
label1 Football or chicken-fried meats ?
label1 If you want to blend in with Penny's friends  I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage 
label1 That's exactly what my father said  Come to the games  watch the games  week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college  Longest seven years of my life 
label1 Are you making this a tier one friendship request ?
label1 Yeah  yeah  All right  Poindexter  sit down  shut up and listen 
label1 That's how my father always began our football conversations  And if you'd like  after the game  I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself 
label1 When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica  Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's ?
label1 Nothing  That  however  appears to be a football cocktail dress 
label1 Leonard  wait  Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her ?
label1 How would you put it ?
label1 Huh  Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse  Don't you have access to women who will do it for money ? By the way  another accepted usage for the term ho 
label1 What's funny about Cylon toast ?
label1 Thank you  I'd like to make a sandwich  but I'm out of bread 
label1 You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator  Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules  which occurs faster at cool temperatures 
label1 So Leonard  how goes the mimesis ?
label1 You know  Mimesis  An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism  Mimesis 
label1 I can see that  I was providing you with an alternative  A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances 
label1 Oh  Research Lab is more than a game  It's like the slogan says  the physics is theoretical  but the fun is real 
label1 Oh ! Great roll ! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider 
label1 You're a natural at this  Penny  And as the first beta testers  you two'll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday 
label1 Why not ?
label1 Roll the dice  Leonard 
label1 Come on  Leonard  if you roll a six  Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown  See what I mean when I say the fun is real ?
label1 I'll just roll for you 
label1 Uh-oh ! Industrial accident 
label1 You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser  Lose one turn and a retina 
label1 It's also your roll 
label1 Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end ?
label1 Hey  I thought of a game we can play in the car 
label1 It's called Scientists  Now  I will name three scientists  then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields  To make this game even more compelling  you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field  not the validity of the field itself  For example  Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology  Okay  ready to have some fun ?
label1 All right  I'll start with an easy one  um  Isaac Newton  Madame Curie and Niels Bohr 
label1 Hint  Madame Curie had her husband to help her 
label1 Leonard ! Stop the car !
label1 I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore 
label1 Come on  come on  we're late 
label1 I believe my alarm is appropriate  given the situation  The movie starts in 17 minutes  which means we'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard  plus skip the concession stand  and preshow urination 
label1 Go  go  Power Rangers  go !
label1 No  we're not  We're standing in the hallway  suffering through an awkward encounter 
label1 All right  invitation pointlessly offered  invitation declined as expected  everyone's civil  nobody's fighting  Have a nice evening 
label1 Got it 
label1 This is a restaurant  It's lunchtime  I would think  as a waitress  you'd be familiar with the paradigm 
label1 No  I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize 
label1 I assumed that would be your attitude  Hence  my true purpose in coming here 
label1 Excuse me  miss  I'd like to order lunch 
label1 I have a few questions  First  I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich ?
label1 You can't make a half-sandwich  If it's not half of a whole sandwich  it's just a small sandwich 
label1 Of course not  I'll have my usual 
label1 Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage ?
label1 Yes  I want you to apologize to Leonard 
label1 Irrelevant  The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable 
label1 All right  let's assume  ad argumentum  that in this case  Leonard is wrong 
label1 Considering the number of transgressions you've committed that he's overlooked  don't you think that  just this once  you could return the favour ?
label1 Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you ?
label1 That's actually from my list  but Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it 
label1 Because  according to him  you're oversensitive and have a temper 
label1 Go apologize to Penny 
label1 Right now would be good 
label1 Although  a few minutes ago would have been better 
label1 Don't flatter yourself  I'm just ignoring you 
label1 I've heard that before  but then  the next thing you know I'm hiding in my bedroom  blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf  and my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates 
label1 Really ? Where's your friend Justin going to sleep ?
label1 Can I get this comic book  too ?
label1 I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot 
label1 Sheldon's log  stardate 633453  While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower  I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states  Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship 
label1 And good evening to you  Siam Palace  This is Sheldon Cooper  Yeah  I'm going to be dining alone this evening  so I'll be reducing my usual order  I'd like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and  uh  one half of the golden treasure for two  Oh  for heaven's sake  in the mid - 18th century  King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne  Surely  you  his cultural descendant  can handle pad thai and dumplings 
label1 I need to go  but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelpcom recently took down a local muffin store 
label1 Penny ?
label1 Not surprising  You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction 
label1 I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub 
label1 They're holding umbrellas 
label1 The ducks in my tub 
label1 They're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for  nor the ability to use umbrellas 
label1 Well  assuming you're correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket  I would certainly think so 
label1 I don't drive 
label1 Well  it seems we've reached an impasse 
label1 But I could call you a cab or an ambulance 
label1 All right  Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress 
label1 Well  it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99 - cent adhesive ducks  we both might die in a fiery car crash 
label1 I see no organizational system in here whatsoever  Which panties do you wear on Mondays ?
label1 My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident 
label1 That doesn't mean one won't be in another  especially if I'm driving 
label1 Okay  here 
label1 We should have you checked for a concussion 
label1 All right 
label1 Don't look ?
label1 Oh  Well  that's understandable  You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology  Uh  Lot and his wife  Perseus and Medusa  Orpheus and Eurydice 
label1 They always look  It never ends well 
label1 For the record  I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle 
label1 Yes  and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator 
label1 One moment  According to my driver's ed book  a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver's door handle is visible in the lower right corner  There's the handle  Oh  no  too far  bringing it back  Optimized  Now  where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror ?
label1 Where is the passenger side mirror ?
label1 Yes  As soon as I adjust my seat  Whee ! Oh  dear  I'm going to have to start again 
label1 Oh  I think we're going sufficiently fast  What's that ?
label1 Mr  Spock did not pilot the Enterprise  He was the science officer  and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise's check engine light blinking  he would pull the ship over immediately 
label1 Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock ?
label1 No  it isn't  But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup 
label1 Sorry  As I told you  the hero always peeks 
label1 All right  And how did the accident occur ?
label1 Cause of accident  lack of adhesive ducks  Okay  medical history  Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes ?
label1 Kidney disease ?
label1 Migraines ?
label1 Are you currently pregnant ?
label1 When was your last menstrual period ?
label1 I'll put  in progress  Okay  moving to psychiatric disorders  list all major behavioural diagnoses  e  g  depression  anxiety  etcetera 
label1 Episodes of sub psychotic rage 
label1 Possible Tourette's  All right  moles  lesions or other skin conditions  Soup tattoo on right buttock 
label1 I'm sorry  There  there  Everything's going to be fine  Sheldon's here 
label1 Now remember  you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer  so  uh  don't operate heavy machinery  Try not to choke on your own drool 
label1 Yes  The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds 
label1 I see  Now  are we talking date  the social interaction  or date  the dried fruit ?
label1 Oh  good  my turn  Well  this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know '
label1 Thank you  Kripke  for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends 
label1 My thank you was not sincere 
label1 Yes  they're interviewing me by phone from my office  regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices  It's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy 
label1 Thank you  My mother is very excited  She's convening her Bible study group to listen in  and then pray for my soul 
label1 Excuse me  may I interject ?
label1 Biologically speaking  Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line 
label1 Now  whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is  of course  an entirely different question 
label1 Of course  First  consider an ordinary magnet which has 
label1 A requirement for string theory  or M-theory  if you will  is the existence of such monopoles  I  myself  led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles  Kripke  I found the nozzle ! I'm going to kill you !
label1 I was humiliated on national radio  How do you think I'm doing ?
label1 What do you want ?
label1 It wasn't funny 
label1 I refuse to sink to his level 
label1 I never admit defeat 
label1 However  on an unrelated topic  I am never getting out of this bed again 
label1 Well  I suppose I could poison Kripke 
label1 It's a simple matter  There are several toxic chemicals that'd be untraceable in an autopsy 
label1 Oh ! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair ? He'll sit down  it'll sound like he's flatulent  even though he's not 
label1 All right  how's this for revenge ? A solution of hydrogen peroxide  and one of saturated potassium iodide 
label1 Mountain Dew  Ah  refreshing  Now  we're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap  creating a little exothermic release of oxygen 
label1 Yes  exactly 
label1 Already taken care of  Observe  This is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam I was able to install  thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket  At the same time  I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling 
label1 You flatter me  sir 
label1 The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room  Mwah  ha  ha 
label1 It may be low-tech  but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity 
label1 I made a boo-boo  all right ?
label1 No  It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution  This is essentially why you have famine in India 
label1 Leonard 
label1 Wait  no  that's a false equivalency  More does not equal merry  If there were 2000 people in this apartment right now  would we be celebrating ? No  we'd be suffocating 
label1 Don't Sheldon me  We ordered for five people  not six 
label1 Perhaps there's hope for you after all 
label1 My mother was right  Hell is real 
label1 Yes  Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels 
label1 Howard ?
label1 Your shoes are delightful  Where did you get them ?
label1 Bazinga  I don't care 
label1 That's not fair  I got stuck behind a tree 
label1 Just need a little more practice 
label1 It's not about shoes  is it ? I don't think I could go through that again 
label1 Then speak 
label1 A little physics ? There's no such thing  Physics encompasses the entire universe  from quantum particles to supernovas  from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies 
label1 Why can't Leonard teach you ?
label1 Penny  this would be a massive undertaking  and my time is both limited and valuable 
label1 Okay  point  What sort of foundation do you have ? Did you take any science classes in school ?
label1 The one with the frogs 
label1 I'm sorry  Penny  I don't think so 
label1 Interesting  I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla  I could teach you some rudimentary physics 
label1 Not likely  KoKo learned to understand over 2000 words  not one of which had anything to do with shoes 
label1 Research journal  entry one  I'm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career  teaching Penny physics  I'm calling it Project Gorilla 
label1 Come in  Take a seat  Subject has arrived  I've extended a friendly casual greeting 
label1 One moment  Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic  Apparently  ignorance is bliss  All right  let us begin  Where's your notebook ?
label1 How are you going to take notes without a notebook ?
label1 How else are you gonna study for the tests ?
label1 Tests  Here  It's college-ruled  I hope that's not too intimidating 
label1 You're welcome  Now  Introduction to Physics  What is physics ? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika  It's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes  Physika means the science of natural things  And it is there  in ancient Greece  that our story begins 
label1 Hush  If you have questions  raise your hand  It's a warm summer evening  circa 600 BC  you've finished your shopping at the local market  or agora  and you look up at the night sky  There you notice some of the stars seem to move  so you name them planetes  or wanderer  Yes  Penny ?
label1 This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off 
label1 Yeah  give or take  As I was saying  it's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece Yes  Penny ?
label1 Can't you hold it ?
label1 Now  remember  Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion  So let's plug in our 98 meters per second squared as A and we get force  Earth gravity  equals mass times 98 meters per second per second  So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this ?
label1 No  Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts  Don't write that down !
label1 Now  if MA equals MG what does that imply ?
label1 How can you not know ? I just told you  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head ?
label1 I'm sorry 
label1 Really ? Of those two explanations  which one seems the most likely ?
label1 All right  It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece '
label1 Okay ! At what point did you begin to feel lost ?
label1 Greece 
label1 There's no need to get frustrated  people learn at different rates  Unlike objects falling in a vacuum  which ' ? MA equals MG ?
label1 That's no reason to cry  One cries because one is sad  For example  I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad 
label1 And to answer it  we first must ask ourselves  what is physics ?
label1 It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece '
label1 Excuse me  but the sun is essential for all life on Earth  Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat  A crime  by the way  for which he is never brought to account 
label1 Oh  yes  We had a tree  we had a manger  we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn  And to make things even more jolly  there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures 
label1 I do not  But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this 
label1 You're kidding  right ? It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton 
label1 Wait  excuse me  but it's much more Christmassy than anything you've put on the tree 
label1 I sense that's not sincere  although I have no idea why 
label1 No  Isaac goes at the top of the tree 
label1 Well  perhaps when your mother gets here  she'll talk some sense into you 
label1 If I can interject again  Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family  who have all chosen high-achieving partners  He probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu 
label1 No trouble at all 
label1 August 16th  Right after her carpal tunnel surgery 
label1 You did 
label1 Neither do I  but it's the social convention 
label1 Well  I'm not sure about interesting  but '
label1 Very well  Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v  Gottfried Leibniz ?
label1 Isn't she brilliant  Leonard ? How I envy you 
label1 September 22nd 
label1 I didn't make tea for you  This is my tea 
label1 Oh  is it ? We're conversing  Checkmate 
label1 What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five 
label1 That's not the comforting part 
label1 If it's any consolation  I'm not happy about it either  Good night 
label1 Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door ?
label1 You're very welcome 
label1 I don't blame you  You were intoxicated 
label1 I blame Penny 
label1 I don't understand  What other kind of women are there ?
label1 It is great  isn't it ? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us 
label1 All right  Well  I'm going to perform full backup  reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems 
label1 Well  I understand there are several types of artificial women  Maybe you should look into that 
label1 I'm sorry  Raj  I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight  Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s 
label1 I don't need anything at the Galleria  Do you need anything at the Galleria ?
label1 That's a semantically null sentence 
label1 If outside is so good  why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside ?
label1 Let me offer you a compromise  Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery  I use my imagination 
label1 One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy  Flatland 
label1 You're only saying that because you haven't been there  I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects 
label1 Well  you're in luck  there's a mixer here in Flatland  Oh  look  there's a sexually attractive line segment  you should chat her up 
label1 Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern 
label1 What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low ?
label1 I would like a root beer float 
label1 They don't ? Well  apparently  these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party 
label1 And don't be chintzy with the Shirley 
label1 All right  There's a female 
label1 But she's female  Isn't that the game ?
label1 Oh  yes  So  the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with ?
label1 Okay  What is your game ?
label1 When I lie through my teeth to a woman  you nod and agree 
label1 It's a limited edition Green Lantern lantern  My friend is looking for someone to copulate with 
label1 I'm Sheldon  How do you do ?
label1 I thought your father was a gynaecologist  I'm sorry 
label1 In brightest day  in darkest night  no evil shall escape my sight 
label1 Thank you  Have you chosen one to copulate with ?
label1 We scored  I'm the wingman 
label1 It means come in  It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer  I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom  and now I thought I'd learn Finnish 
label1 Yes  exactly  I had a great time  That's done  I've moved on to other things  For example  after I learn Finnish  I'm not going to learn Finnish again 
label1 Raj  I highly doubt there is any argument you can make  threat you might levy  rhetorical strategy  plea  invocation  supplication  or vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider 
label1 Hulk agree to second date with puny humans !
label1 Hulk sad 
label1 Time for bed 
label1 Good night  puny human !
label1 Well  I suppose  Come in  I'll sleep in Leonard's room  Good night 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  they re-did the menu 
label1 Oh  is it ? Look at this  General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under specialties  It's now under chicken 
label1 Yes  General Tso 
label1 Perhaps  Perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime  For all we know  the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters 
label1 Good idea  We'll go to Corleone's 
label1 You know  the more I think about it  the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain chunks of mobster 
label1 It was listed under seafood 
label1 Leonard  are we having a serious conversation or not ?
label1 Oh God  oh God  oh  God ! It's all right  They didn't take my comic books 
label1 When does the CSI team get here ?
label1 In anticipation of their arrival  I've bagged some evidence  One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home  You should be able to pull some good prints off this  And now  here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect 
label1 I'm sorry  Leonard  It's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job 
label1 I'm not crazy  My mother had me tested 
label1 I'm sorry  that's the end of your inquiry ?
label1 Oh  my goodness  Where do I begin ? For instance  my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem 
label1 Oh  how I wish I could 
label1 I do not have to urinate  I am the master of my own bladder  Drat 
label1 We just had a major crime in the building  and you open the door without asking who it is ?
label1 Nothing  Just wanted to see if you were both okay 
label1 All right  then  Good night 
label1 Uh-huh 
label1 It's not what I want  it's what evolution wants  Human beings are primates  Primates have evolved to live in groups  both for protection and support 
label1 I do tonight  It's scary over there 
label1 Good Lord  I could not have made this easier  Hydrogen atom  H  plus pigs minus pea  Higgs  Bow  General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone  Bow-zone  Pear  Tickle  Pear-tickle  Higgs Boson Particle  How could you not get that ?
label1 All right  I'll take the first watch and wake you at 0400 
label1 Bad idea 
label1 Listen to her  Jim 
label1 What if someone steals my keys ?
label1 Better 
label1 Sheldon's journal  Security system in place  However  sleep continues to elude me  I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena  this so-called City of Roses  and it haunts me  Ah  the injustice  I lie here awake  tormented  while out there evil lurks  probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo 
label1 I heard a noise 
label1 Why would you knock over a lamp ?
label1 Oh ! No  she's right  I don't need to know what you were doing  Carry on 
label1 Would you like me to bring you some warm milk ?
label1 And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises  very thoughtful  Warm milk  Penny ?
label1 Fine  Good night to you  sir  Miss 
label1 My new computer came with Windows 7  Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista  I don't like that 
label1 Our apartment was broken into  our security system tried to kill me  and as a result  I'm leaving Pasadena forever  Tell me how that's overreacting 
label1 Oh  if that were only true  Unfortunately  as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future  I need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena  Like Enid  Oklahoma  Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity  but no model train shops  Sorry  Enid 
label1 It will take me a few days to get settled  After I do  I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman  Montana  In the meantime  please forward my mail 
label1 I sense you're making a joke  but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin  so do not forward my mail there 
label1 Please  Penny  as you know  I'm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion  so I prepared a short video 
label1 That is a bracing cold  an invigorating cold  Lord  is it cold !
label1 Thank you  fellow Bozite  And may I say  you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town's Chamber of Commerce 
label1 Interesting  The acquaintance is the first to greet me 
label1 Is it morning ?
label1 Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus ?
label1 Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile  not an alligator  If you're going to mock me  at least get your facts straight 
label1 I can't see it ! It just won't coalesce 
label1 You're right 
label1 Electrons move through graphene  act as if they have no mass '
label1 Unit cell contains two carbon atoms  Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees 
label1 Structure  constant structure  One atom '
label1 Pattern is the same as fermions  travels on the pathways  hexagonal  it's always hexagonal '
label1 Not lima beans  carbon atoms 
label1 Peas ! Perfect  they can be electrons 
label1 The plural of coccyx is coccyges 
label1 Good Lord ! You're ruining everything !
label1 Well  I needed something bigger than peas  now  didn't I ?
label1 They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine 
label1 Impaired cognitive function 
label1 But I don't want to go to bed 
label1 Oh  all right 
label1 Size ratio was all wrong  Couldn't visualize it  Needed bigger carbon atoms 
label1 Back door has a five-pin tumbler system  single-circuit alarm  Child's play  You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms 
label1 But I'm still working 
label1 You can try  but you'll never catch me 
label1 I have good news 
label1 Your cell phone was off 
label1 And that didn't work out  did it ?
label1 I came to tell you I've got the answer 
label1 No  no  I'm still hopelessly stuck on that  but I figured out how to figure it out 
label1 Einstein 
label1 Albert Einstein 
label1 When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity  he was working at the patent office 
label1 Don't be absurd  That's in Washington  You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern  No  I'm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task  freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem 
label1 Of course it is  Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow 
label1 You're welcome  Good night to you  too  Oh  by the way  I was watching you sleep for a moment  and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back 
label1 No  I wasn't talking to Leonard 
label1 A menial job  Like yours 
label1 I do  For thousands of years  the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters  until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged  Do you have anything like that ?
label1 Shouldn't you check your database ?
label1 You didn't really type 
label1 I could do that 
label1 One question 
label1 What's sheetrock ?
label1 That seems acceptable 
label1 I don't drive 
label1 I'm trying to get these tables cleared  We're slammed 
label1 A reasonable question  I asked myself  what is the most mind-numbing  pedestrian job conceivable  and three answers came to mind  uh  toll booth attendant  an Apple Store genius  and what Penny does  Now  since I don't like touching other people's coins  and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius  here I am 
label1 Oh  heavens  no  Since I don't need to be paid  I didn't need to be hired  I simply came in  picked up a tray  and started working for the man  Let me get that plate out of your way 
label1 Is it ? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate  Bernadette  table 10 wants their check 
label1 You're right  That is more menial  Hello  I'm Sheldon  I'll be your server today  I don't recommend the salmon  I saw it in the kitchen 
label1 All right  one bacon cheeseburger  breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously  kudos  Beer-battered fish and chips  Now  here's your tartar sauce  I also brought you salsa  It's a little unconventional  but I think you'll like it  It's zingy  And for you  Factory Burrito Grande  no cheese  no sour cream  no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance  Bon app'tit 
label1 Of course 
label1 I'm sorry  I don't work here 
label1 Actually  he might have to  There's an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by others  The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial  but less precise neener-neener 
label1 In pre - 1976 terms  neener-neener 
label1 Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded  wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder ?
label1 Professor Norton  although  God knows why  He hasn't published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize 
label1 In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl ?
label1 This is incredible ! I'm so happy  I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you  I'm just going to run home and start packing 
label1 Of course  my good friend  Come in  Help me out  which ski hat says apr's supercollider ?
label1 Well  of course you are  Who else would you take ?
label1 Sorry ? I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old 
label1 Shame on you ! That's no dream for a scientist !
label1 Not so fast  You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli  Penny 
label1 Afraid not  Do you recognize this ?
label1 Indeed  the roommate agreement  I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C  Future Commitments  Number 37  in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider  now under construction in Switzerland  he shall invite the other friend to accompany him 
label1 He can't kill me  even if I turn 
label1 No  that seemed a little farfetched 
label1 I've lived up to all my commitments under the agreement  At least once a day I ask how you are  even though I simply don't care  I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing 
label1 Very well 
label1 All right  This game is called Traitors  I will name three historical figures  you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal  Benedict Arnold  Judas  Dr  Leonard Hofstadter 
label1 You're right  Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did 
label1 He owns Fox  and they cancelled Firefly  Hint  he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2 
label1 Morning  old chum 
label1 I've made you breakfast  Juice  coffee  and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters  See  here's Frodo 
label1 Yeah  I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet  If you need to void your bladder before eating  I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy 
label1 It's by way of an apology for my recent behaviour  I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements  It's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other  Butterscotch scone ?
label1 What you're tasting is respect and affection  And about a pound of Crisco  After you've finished breakfast  I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary 
label1 I do  It fails as drama  science fiction  and it's hopelessly derivative  But you like it  and you're my friend 
label1 Drat  No Frodo for you 
label1 Alright  let's dispense with the friendly banter  I believe you know why I'm here 
label1 Yes  amusing  Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you  but let me be more specific  I believe you know why I'm here in the laundry room 
label1 Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe  AKA me  And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger  AKA you 
label1 No  it's not  I've got five more slides 
label1 Very well  Enjoy yourself  You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades  I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents 
label1 You will ?
label1 Since I rarely hug  I'm relying on your expertise regarding duration 
label1 Oh  good  Bye-bye 
label1 All right  my friend  Would you like some cholermus ?
label1 Cholermus  It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish  I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland 
label1 Yes  that good news 
label1 Howard  could you lower the lights ? I have a short PowerPoint presentation 
label1 That's a somewhat ambiguous response  Am I going or not ?
label1 I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here  Leonard 
label1 With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates house should I be invited 
label1 Great  I'll start packing  In a minute 
label1 Chicken ?
label1 With the little stars ?
label1 Heated to 180 degrees ?
label1 You don't have to be mean  I'm sick 
label1 Not my problem  I just don't understand how this happened to me  I'm scrupulous about my hygiene  I regularly disinfect my hands  and I avoid contact with other people on general principle 
label1 Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography ? I'm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed 
label1 Well  look who thinks he's Stuart's uncle now 
label1 I've decided I'm going to have Mr  Lee sign my copy of this month's Batman 
label1 Yes  which is why no one else will ask him to sign one  and I will be the possessor of a unique  albeit confusing  artifact  which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom 
label1 Yeah  but the ones in my pocket are mine 
label1 Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet 
label1 I don't trust banks  I believe that when the robots rise up  ATMs will lead the charge 
label1 Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order  From left to right  it's supposed to be federal  state  and then city of Pasadena 
label1 It bothers me 
label1 A summons for what ?
label1 November 16 ? Penny  that's the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room 
label1 Yes  it is 
label1 Penny  I have an eidetic memory  Also  that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder 
label1 Okay  then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car  bearing your license plates  coming to me ?
label1 So you betrayed me ?
label1 I'm not going to pay a fine  That would imply I'm guilty 
label1 I am not guilty  I only have a learner's permit  Penny was the teacher  When the light turned yellow she said go  go  go  so I went  went  went 
label1 Now you see what you've done ? Because of you  we're all going to miss Stan Lee 
label1 Well  you're my friends  You'll be standing by my side  supporting me  feeding me legal precedents  and if you had the upper body strength  carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious 
label1 Howard ?
label1 Raj ? You'll be there  won't you ?
label1 Please try to wear something appropriate  It won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks 
label1 That's just wrong 
label1 Wait  hold on  Before we get to the courthouse  I'd like to call on your skills as an actress 
label1 I've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because  let's face it  you're somewhat of a loose cannon  Now  don't worry  it's written in your vernacular  So shall we rehearse ?
label1 Well  of course you have a choice  Although we live in a deterministic universe  each individual has free will  Now  sit down  I call your attention to the events of November 16  Do you remember that date ?
label1 Excellent  Go on 
label1 And who performed that heroic act ?
label1 There's no need for compliments  this court is only interested in the facts 
label1 Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again 
label1 Good morning  Your Honour  Dr  Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se  That is to say  representing himself 
label1 And yet you wound up in traffic court  Anyway  if it would please the court  I'd like to begin with an opening statement 
label1 Thank you 
label1 I object  You're completely ignoring the law 
label1 Really ? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession  while you preside over the kiddy table of yours 
label1 I am a scientist  I never apologize for the truth 
label1 That's my spot 
label1 Excuse me ? Excuse me  jailor ?
label1 I need to use the restroom 
label1 That's the toilet ?
label1 Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize 
label1 You know very well how it went 
label1 I was found guilty and fined $ 533 
label1 I also now have three points on a driver's licence I do not yet possess  and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology  simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals 
label1 Well  I hope you're satisfied  Penny  You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today 
label1 No  no  I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime  The moving finger writes  and having writ  moves on !
label1 This is Stan Lee's front door  We were on Stan Lee's curb  then we were on Stan Lee's walk  and now we're at Stan Lee's front door 
label1 Oh  Lord  you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell  At Stan Lee's house  We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee 
label1 You said we were invited 
label1 I'll tell you where I've been  You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics  but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order 
label1 Plus  I get to hang out with him again at the hearing  This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy 
label1 Well  it's very simple  In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose  I'm the smart one  Wolowitz is the funny one  and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails  That leaves you  by default  as the muscle 
label1 Of course not  And  technically  magic beans would be food  although eating them would be quite a waste  since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk  which would provide enough roughage for a small city 
label1 Who's Adam West ? Leonard  what do the two of you talk about after the coitus ?
label1 No  what's sad is that you don't know Adam West was TV's Batman 
label1 Fascinating 
label1 It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring 
label1 Yes  there is  Oh  here's a fun fact  ketchup started out as a general term for sauce  typically made of  uh  mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices  Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry  anchovy  oyster  kidney bean and grape 
label1 If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom  I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement 
label1 Well  yes  but I found it in the box  and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure 
label1 Other than the lack of water  how is it not ?
label1 We can't sell it  We have to keep it and love it and polish it  and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies 
label1 You mean my ring ?
label1 The ring was unguarded  it was just sitting on the table  anyone could have taken it  Proof ? I did 
label1 I found it  The ring is mine  I don't understand why in this group I never get my way 
label1 I'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring 
label1 Ow ! You hit me ! I'm bleeding !
label1 You mean this ring ? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men's room 
label1 No  it's mine 
label1 I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile  I have endless patience  I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service 
label1 Excellent  excellent  Tire each other out  the ring will be mine  Howard  why don't you go after Raj's mother ?
label1 Go ahead  I have no illusions about my mother  She is a kind  loving  religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr  Pepper addiction  Anything you'd like to add ?
label1 No ! I call no Meemaws 
label1 I don't want to hear this 
label1 I said stop it !
label1 Waterfalls !
label1 Subliminal messaging  I'm going to make you want to pee  Dripping faucets  Leaky gutter  Peeing 
label1 Oh-ho-ho  it's working all right  I have to pee 
label1 Wait  just to clarify  When you get to three  do we stand up or do we pee ?
label1 Excellent choice 
label1 I've done it ! I've won ! The ring is mine ! It's mine !
label1 I knew it  Give us the precious !
label1 It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about  For example  why wasn't William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie ?
label1 I won ?
label1 I won ! This is astonishing  Not that I won the award  no one deserves it more  Actually  I guess I misspoke  It's not astonishing  more like inevitable  I'm not sure what to do first  Maybe I should call my mother  Wait ! I know  I'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online 
label1 Hello ? Oh  Chancellor Morton  how are you  sir ? Yes  I was expecting your call
label1 They expect me to give a speech at the banquet  I can't give a speech 
label1 Any group big enough to trample me to death  General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children 
label1 I'm not accepting the award 
label1 Thank you  Yeah  I'll bear that in mind if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize 
label1 I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college  Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours 
label1 Don't trample me 
label1 Come on  Mother  you know why I can't accept the award  With all due respect  I don't think praying will help  No  I have not heard the song  Jesus  Take the Wheel  No  no  no  no  no  no  no  you don't need to start singing it  Yes  I'll buy it on the iTunes  Mother  Good-bye  Mother 
label1 Oh  I doubt that  I haven't figured out a way  and I'm much smarter than all of you 
label1 Oh  I'm sorry  that is what I meant 
label1 I do like the X-Men 
label1 I don't know  If you're my X-Men  what are your powers ?
label1 That's not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters  but go on  Leonard ?
label1 What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind ?
label1 I see  Well  I assume  since the rest of you have set the bar so low  you're saving the most impressive contribution for last  Go ahead  Howard  Dazzle me 
label1 No  The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier  Since I am Sheldon Cooper  you will be my C-Men 
label1 And yet  you can't speak to women 
label1 Okay  but don't punch me 
label1 When I was little  my sister would say to me  close your eyes  you'll get a surprise  and then she'd punch me 
label1 That's what my sister used to say 
label1 I'm sorry  Proceed 
label1 Sim City  More specifically  the Sim City I designed  Sheldonopolis 
label1 Where exactly ? Sheldon Square ? Sheldon Towers ? Sheldon Stadium  home of the Fighting Sheldons ?
label1 I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation 
label1 Really ? This time of year ? It's a bit nippy 
label1 Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart 
label1 You know  the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it  so I get a 15 % discount 
label1 Look  I didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly 
label1 Hang on  It's a cardigan  I have to button it  Oh  no 
label1 A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city  I have to get my people to safety  People of Sheldonopolis  this is your mayor  Follow me  If the children can't run  leave them behind  Oh  the simulated horror !
label1 I question your premise  How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people ?
label1 Don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt ?
label1 In the prom department 
label1 Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court 
label1 Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams ?
label1 I recently had a dream that I was a giant  But everything around me was to scale  so it all looked normal 
label1 I was wearing size a million pants 
label1 Ah  the talking cure  Classical Freudian  good choice  If it will help speed things along  uh  my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A  a bat  B  a bat  C  a bat  and D  my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle 
label1 Really  Leonard ? You're just going to try to recycle Adler's doctrine of the inferiority complex ? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's  And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free 
label1 And how did that make you feel ?
label1 So  I hear you saying you're angry with your mother 
label1 Thank you  Leonard 
label1 I can't do this  I'm going to faint 
label1 Alcohol ? I don't drink alcohol 
label1 I'm ready 
label1 Thanks  shorty  I'll take it from here  All right  you people ready to have some fun ? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology ? Well  then here come the jokes  Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip ? To get to the same side  bazinga ! All right  a neutron walks into a bar and asks  how much for a drink ? The bartender says  for you  no charge  Hello ? I know you're out there  I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide  Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience  Dr  Randall from the geology department  only man who's happy when they take his work for granite  Ba-da cha ! I kid the geologists  of course  but it's only ' cause I have no respect for the field  Let's get serious for a moment  Why are we all here ? ' Cause we're scientists  And what do scientists study ? The universe  And what's the universe made of ? I am so glad you asked 
label1 Penny  Leonard  Would you be able to answer some questions I'm having about the events of last night ?
label1 Question one  where are my pants ?
label1 What do I search ?
label1 n Sheldon : All right  people  let's get down to the math  It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination  Can I take my pants off over my head ? Of course not  My body's in the way  But if we had access to higher dimensions  we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over 
label1 Oh  Lord  this couldn't be any more humiliating 
label1 n Sheldon : Now  for the astronomers in the audience  get ready to see the dark side of the moon  And here's Uranus 
label1 You are ignoring the square-cube law  The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton  And for the record  the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack  hoverboard  transporter  Batmobile  and then giant ant 
label1 Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle 
label1 Not literally  But as far back as the 17th century  scientists observed a 33 - day fluctuation in men's hormone levels 
label1 Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size  And on a side note  they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis 
label1 For the record  giant rats are possible 
label1 But I sense you're going to and I don't want to hear about it  Excuse me 
label1 That is what is referred to as a burn on you 
label1 Good  Penny  reminder  bowling tonight at seven o'clock 
label1 We would indeed  In this particular case  your lack of femininity works to our advantage 
label1 Sarcasm ?
label1 Remember  seven o'clock 
label1 Pacific Daylight time !
label1 Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes 
label1 These are my own bowling shoes 
label1 I know where my feet have been 
label1 Well  well  well  If it isn't Wil Wheaton  the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man  the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo  the Internet Explorer to my Firefox 
label1 Oh  I'm ready  I don't know if Stuart told you what you're up against tonight  but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team  Seven to twelve year-old division  Also  Penny's pretty good 
label1 This is for you 
label1 I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy  When she's upset  she says Ach and eats ice cream 
label1 If you were a cat  I would have brought you a lasagna 
label1 I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep 
label1 And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette 
label1 No  Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream 
label1 The part where I tell you I've engineered a rematch with Stuart's team for tonight 
label1 When are you going to talk to him ?
label1 He's in the laundry room now  Now would be a good time 
label1 Oh  I think we both know the answer to that question 
label1 All right ! Fence mended  problem swept under the rug  Time to bowl ! Yes  I was eavesdropping  there's a lot at stake here 
label1 Attention  all bowlers  I've taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch 
label1 No  not the Wesley Crushers  The Wesley ' Crushers  '
label1 What ? No ! Again  it's not the Wesley Crushers  It's the Wesley ' Crushers  '
label1 Do you people even hear yourselves ? It's not the Wesley Crushers  It's not the ' Wesley Crushers  It's the Wesley ' Crushers  '
label1 Oh  yes  The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor  FYI  I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis 
label1 All right 
label1 I so loathe you 
label1 That's not even from your franchise !
label1 Be the ball  Howard 
label1 You weren't the ball 
label1 Excuse me  I don't know who you're chanting for as I am currently the ball 
label1 Well  if he does  don't believe it  He's not above playing the dead meemaw card 
label1 All right  remember  his meemaw's alive and be the ball 
label1 Wait ! Where are you going ? Penny  come back ! I'll get you ice cream !
label1 Are you insane ? If she leaves  it's over !
label1 No  I suppose not 
label1 Wheaton !
label1 I think you mean telekinetically  And no  I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus 
label1 Well  we could if it were true  But as you live in the same building  you see each other all the time  The variable which has changed is the coitus 
label1 Good  good  I'm glad we're still friends 
label1 Oh  yes  It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life  I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain 
label1 Well  my existence is a continuum  so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period 
label1 Bazinga 
label1 He seems all right  Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on  Oh  but now that I think of it  he asked me not to tell you that 
label1 I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it  I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce 
label1 That's the sauce my mother uses  She likes cooking Italian because according to her  that's what the Romans made Jesus eat 
label1 I'm hungry now 
label1 Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce ?
label1 Is he making any progress ? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil 
label1 Well  usually I'm on the team that picks last  Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair 
label1 Well  of course I'm hungry  And as I have no plans to eat with any other team  I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto  Mm  mm  mm !
label1 Just out of curiosity  do we still have hot dogs ?
label1 Just making dinner conversation  Go  Team Leonard !
label1 Certainly  It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly  Mm  mm  mm !
label1 Excuse me  I'm thirsty  so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage 
label1 Ah  I do so love beverages  Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk 
label1 I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion  but increases serotonin  and you know me  if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage  it's serotonin  Bye-bye 
label1 Oh  that's not necessary  You can go first 
label1 I can't think of a reason why not 
label1 Hold on  Nope  no reason 
label1 All right  say hello to your mother for me 
label1 I didn't say outside 
label1 No  of course not  That would be odd and suspicious behavior 
label1 Which way are you going ?
label1 I'm going the other way  Bye 
label1 No  I mean  I have no idea what you smell 
label1 I shall  Have a nice scoot 
label1 Oh  yes  In fact  he said  I'm fine  I don't care  And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal 
label1 I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you 
label1 Oh  I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention 
label1 Just making polite dinner conversation  Your turn 
label1 No  It's just a suspicion I have  Mmm  mmm  mmm 
label1 I do  Leonard never cooks for me 
label1 You can't cook and you made me this 
label1 Oh  Lord  I'm in Jewish hell 
label1 Satellites are down  Solar flares 
label1 Thanks for seeing me on such short notice 
label1 Maybe this isn't a good time 
label1 Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation ? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me 
label1 You may want to sit down 
label1 I've been seeing Penny behind your back 
label1 We had dinner last night  She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it  Well  little hot dog  I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog  A real  big dog  A hell hound  Tangential to the primary story  How about I circle back to it ?
label1 I didn't want to upset you  Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money 
label1 Yes  but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos 
label1 Oh  Well  so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified ?
label1 Well then as my meemaw would say  looks like we butchered a pig  but nobody wanted bacon 
label1 We stayed for the California Adventure water show  It was pure Disney magic 
label1 I can still eat 
label1 Okay  but just don't fight
label1 Thank you  Penny 
label1 Explain your sneeze 
label1 Do you have allergies ?
label1 Is there too much pepper on your salad ?
label1 I've heard enough  Sit over there 
label1 That's what Typhoid Mary said  and clearly  her friends buckled 
label1 Oh  Leonard  I have something for you  Per our roommate agreement  this is your 24 - hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment 
label1 Of course  Pets are banned under the roommate agreement  with the exception of service animals  such as seeing eye dogs and  one day  cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys 
label1 For your information  I'll be playing host to Dr  Elizabeth Plimpton 
label1 Yes  And until you acquire a surgical mask  please address your comments to me through a napkin  We've been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe  And now she's under consideration for a position at our university 
label1 I didn't realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you're a fan of  but very well  You enjoy Canadian bacon  I've been to Toronto 
label1 My room  of course 
label1 A  I rarely kid  And B  when I do kid  you will know it by my use of the word bazinga 
label1 Yes  Bazinga  Leonard ?
label1 Well  she doesn't care for hotels  And who can blame her ? Windows that don't open  multi-user linens  keys shaped like credit cards  as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet  All right  I believe I have time for one more question  Yes  Raj ?
label1 When I've seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart  You know the drill  All right  if you'll excuse me  I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics 
label1 Oh  Penny  excellent  I have a question about these maxi pads  Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype ?
label1 The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject 
label1 I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days 
label1 I want her to feel at home  I also bought scented soaps  pantyhose  Midol  calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel 
label1 A word of warning  My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology  so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber 
label1 Shoe sales  hair styles  mud masks  gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina 
label1 Oh  good grief  This isn't about you  Coming ! Now listen  one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century  So pay attention  Years from now  my biographer might ask you about this event 
label1 I apologize  He's only an experimental physicist 
label1 Excellent  If the yogurt works  I bought some delightful scented candles 
label1 No  he doesn't understand  I understand 
label1 You're just misappropriating my understanding 
label1 From the mind that brought you hi-lo  Let me show you to your room 
label1 Get it together  man 
label1 All right  let me show you some of the features of the room  First  windows  Conventional  Open  closed  open  closed  halfway open  or halfway closed  depending on your philosophical bent  Over here is my comic book collection  Feel free to browse  There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand 
label1 In here  you'll find emergency provisions  An eight-day supply of food and water  a crossbow  season two of Star Trek : The Original Series on a high-density flash drive 
label1 Then there's really no reason to live  is there ?
label1 Well  there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall  It ended as inexplicably as it began  They had very little in common  except for carnal activity  That's why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones  If you decide to use them  please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you'll find in the bathroom  They're in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes 
label1 Good  I'll leave you to your night time ablutions  I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule  You'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet  It's on the back of the emergency escape route diagram 
label1 Sleep well  my friend 
label1 Oh  let me just get one thing  It's my backup emergency supply kit  The living room escape route doesn't pass through here  Now  good night  And if there's an apocalypse  good luck 
label1 Vocal test  Morning vocal test  Second vocal test  Second morning vocal test 
label1 Morning 
label1 Morning  I trust you had a pleasant night 
label1 Excuse me  I'm going to relieve myself 
label1 All right  Elizabeth  the bathroom is yours  The seat is down  and has been sanitized for your protection 
label1 Ah  so the yogurt didn't work  I'll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer 
label1 Leonard  Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work 
label1 Wonderful  Meaningless pleasantries accomplished  Elizabeth  Leonard's bathroom time is coming up  and believe me  you do not want to follow him 
label1 Excuse me  I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr  Plimpton  who I assure you has better things to do 
label1 The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts ?
label1 I must say  I'm shocked by this betrayal 
label1 Not Penny  me !
label1 Elizabeth's my friend  and you're playing with her !
label1 Dr  Plimpton  I'd like you to meet my colleagues  Dr  Rajesh Koothrappali
label1 And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz 
label1 And of course  you've already introduced yourself to Dr  Hofstadter 
label1 ldon : Yes ?
label1 ldon : I know what I said  I know what you said  I know what my mother said on March 5  1992  What is the sixth noble gas ?
label1 ldon : You said you're a scientist  What is the sixth noble gas ?
label1 ldon : All right  next question  Kirk or Picard ?
label1 ldon : That depends 
label1 ldon : No  but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers 
label1 ldon : No ! That's where I sit !
label1 ldon : This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer  It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation  As a result  I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs 
label1 ldon : Hmm 
label1 ldon : Doesn't concern you  You'll be going to the university every day ?
label1 ldon : And you have a vehicle ?
label1 ldon : And you'll be willing to drive me ?
label1 ldon : I can  I choose not to 
label1 ldon : Why don't you let me do this 
label1 ldon : Last question  In a post-apocalyptic world  which task would you assign the highest priority ? Locating a sustainable food source  re-establishing a functioning government  procreating  or preserving the knowledge of mankind ?
label1 ldon : That's correct  FYI  I would have accepted any answer other than procreating  Come  I'll show you the rest of the apartment 
label1 ldon : The second barrier  Don't get cocky  This is the bathroom  Are you fairly regular ?
label1 ldon : This isn't going to work if you're guessing  When do you evacuate your bowels ?
label1 ldon : When you have to ? I'm sorry  I don't rent to hippies 
label1 ldon : I can't give you eight  I can give you seven thirty 
label1 ldon : Third barrier passed  You have won the right to see your room  Huzzah !
label1 ldon : I don't understand 
label1 ldon : Do you do this often ?
label1 ldon : Your room  You may want to repaint 
label1 ldon : Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly 
label1 ldon : We might as well settle it now  it's going to be on for years  Initial here  All right  that's television and movies  Section nine  miscellany  The apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure 
label1 ldon : Never fly it upside down unless the apartment's in distress  And next  if either of us ever invents time travel  we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds 
label1 ldon : Well that's disappointing 
label1 ldon : I'm just going to keep knocking till you answer 
label1 ldon : 12 hours ?
label1 ldon : What is going on here ?
label1 ldon : I'll get to you later  What are you sitting on ?
label1 ldon : But what's wrong with the furniture we have ?
label1 ldon : Did it occur to you that was by design ?
label1 ldon : But you didn't notify me by e-mail  so this is still a breach 
label1 ldon : Oh  you did  did you ? Oh  drat ! Hoisted by my own spam filter 
label1 ldon : I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano  entitled this is funny 
label1 ldon : I assure you  you'll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs 
label1 ldon : Yes 
label1 ldon : It's not an assumption  Change seats with me 
label1 ldon : I don't like this spot  I have to keep turning my head 
label1 ldon : We don't watch Babylon 5 in this apartment 
label1 ldon : Because no one likes Babylon 5 
label1 ldon : They don't get a vote  It's one against one  And according to the roommate agreement  all ties will be settled by me 
label1 ldon : And I said yes  And I settle all ties  Change seats with me 
label1 ldon : There's a draft on my neck over here 
label1 ldon : You're protected by your turtleneck 
label1 ldon : Hmm  I'm still not comfortable  Of course  There's too many people here 
label1 ldon : Wait  Let me get my jacket 
label1 ldon : Why not ?
label1 ldon : Oh  Well  in that case  I don't need my jacket  And for the record  the correct syntax is I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away  Oh  yes  this is definitely going to be my spot 
label1 ldon : Won't work 
label1 ldon : You don't see your mistake  do you ?
label1 ldon : This is for a full-scale rocket  not a model 
label1 ldon : Not correctly 
label1 ldon : Give me that 
label1 Hello  Why do I smell methacrylate ?
label1 There's doubt ?
label1 There you go 
label1 Go ahead 
label1 I should've brought an umbrella 
label1 I know that  but with skin as fair as mine  moon burn is a real possibility 
label1 Leonard  Leonard  What is that ? What is that ?
label1 Not my world 
label1 I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location 
label1 Thank you  Raj  keep an eye out for the other one 
label1 Yes  In 1917  when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung  his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin ' 
label1 See  now this is a man for Penny 
label1 Well it's not a great question  How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon ? That's a great question 
label1 Make it so 
label1 I was wrong  Penny can do better 
label1 All right  let me restate that  It's very heavy  and I don't want to 
label1 What's going on ?
label1 In what universe is this low-pulp ? Good morning  Penny 
label1 FYI  my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night 
label1 As a native Texan  I must say I've never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context 
label1 Oh  God  That I've heard on multiple occasions  In what universe is that lightly toasted ? This has to be the worst day of my life  Good morning  Leonard 
label1 Counting this instance ? 317 
label1 She returned to her apartment  I presume to shower and vomit  Not necessarily in that order 
label1 Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour ?
label1 I have no difficulty believing you're not butter 
label1 Who's going to tell whom about what ?
label1 Your surprise confuses me  I live here 
label1 Be more specific 
label1 That's not afternoon  That's preevning 
label1 It's a time of day I invented  It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening  Preevning  I'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need 
label1 Well  tomorrow's Saturday  Saturday night is laundry night  so I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking 
label1 I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air  exhausted by your constant tomfoolery 
label1 Please  Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would  the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum 
label1 Well  most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it's wondering why I'm having this conversation with you 
label1 He didn't date  It was pon farr  His blood boiled with mating lust 
label1 As I will not be engaging in this nonsense  my choice of beverage is moot  But for the record  I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them 
label1 What's life without whimsy ?
label1 You're bluffing 
label1 Curse you 
label1 In a few minutes  when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise  how would you prefer I do it ? The standard I told you so ? The classic neener-neener ? Or just my normal look of haughty derision ?
label1 Interesting  My mother and I have the same agreement about church 
label1 Well  then you might want to avoid East Texas 
label1 May I buy you a beverage ?
label1 Impressive  but we must be cautious 
label1 Today  it's a Chinese food retrieval robot  Tomorrow  it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor 
label1 No one ever does  That's why it happens 
label1 You realize  Penny  that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete 
label1 I thought you broke up with her  Why is she here ?
label1 She's not my girlfriend 
label1 She's not my girlfriend 
label1 She's not my girlfriend 
label1 All right  everyone pay attention  Yes  I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler  Yes  she is female  Yes  we communicate on a daily basis  but no  she is not my girlfriend 
label1 Well  my work in physics  her work in neurobiology  and most recently  the possibility of our having a child together 
label1 Amy pointed out that between the two of us  our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior  benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow 
label1 Yes  Penny 
label1 Why on Earth would we have sex ?
label1 I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce  which is messy  unsanitary  and based on living next to you for three years  involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity 
label1 Yes  exactly  Consequently  if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world  it will be accomplished clinically  with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes  Which reminds me  you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour  Is your womb available for rental ?
label1 You mean dating ?
label1 I can't date Amy 
label1 She's not my girlfriend 
label1 Oh  I hadn't considered that  I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny  And you don't think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging ?
label1 Huh  It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me 
label1 I know  I can see the shadow of your feet under the door 
label1 If you're looking for an example of a waste of time  I would refer you to the conversation we're having right now 
label1 I've decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler 
label1 Wait  You have to drive me 
label1 You know I don't drive 
label1 I did  He said  and I quote  ask Penny  it was her cockamamie idea 
label1 Actually  I'm paraphrasing  Having been raised in a Christian household  I'm uncomfortable with the language he used  And to be honest  I'm not entirely comfortable with cockamamie 
label1 Hurry  We're going to be late 
label1 I'm sorry  Do you have other plans ?
label1 So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy ?
label1 Thank you for driving me 
label1 I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops  It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops 
label1 Sorry  I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality 
label1 Given your community college education  I encourage you to ask me as many as possible 
label1 That depends  Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date ?
label1 I have a master's degree and two doctorates  The things I should know  I do know 
label1 If you know so much  how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it ?
label1 Don't bother  I've wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill 
label1 Oh  no  I wouldn't care for that  Amy ?
label1 I'm sorry  how is this better than uncomfortable silence ?
label1 Big night ? The winter solstice is a big night  It's over 14 hours in Southern California 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Apparently  a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count 
label1 Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few 
label1 Simple extrapolation  In the three years that I've known you  you were single for two  During that time  I saw 17 different suitors  If we work backwards  correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15 '
label1 I'm sorry  16 ?
label1 Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate 
label1 Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning  plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before '
label1 So we multiply 193  minus 21 men before the loss of virginity  so 172 times 018 gives us 3096 sexual partners  Let's round that up to 31 
label1 This is an interesting topic  How many sexual encounters have you had ?
label1 I should think so 
label1 You were right  This was a very productive evening  I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight 
label1 Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny 
label1 In these uncertain times  doesn't humanity deserve a gift ?
label1 Curses 
label1 Well  it's not that late  You could still go out and look for number 32  Good night 
label1 I've decided not to procreate 
label1 The humorous implication being that I am Wile E  Coyote ?
label1 And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury ?
label1 What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die 
label1 My family history factoring in longevity  propensity for disease  et cetera 
label1 Killed by badger 
label1 It was Thanksgiving  Uncle Carl said  I think there's a badger living in our chimney  Hand me that flashlight  Those were the last words he ever spoke to us 
label1 Not true  The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically  Instead of fleeing  he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family  Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA ?
label1 But seriously  even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor  at best I have 60 years left 
label1 60 only takes me to here  I need to get to here 
label1 The earliest estimate of the singularity  when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality 
label1 By this much 
label1 You don't get it  Leonard  I'm going to miss so much  the unified field theory  cold fusion  the dogapus 
label1 I was going to  I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday 
label1 A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls  No one can hate that 
label1 It's a small price to pay 
label1 In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics  I need to change my diet 
label1 Correct 
label1 Essentially  yes 
label1 Flattering  but sadly  no  I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system  AKA jogging 
label1 Certainly  I've run from bullies  dogs  angry chickens  and one particularly persistent P  E  teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test 
label1 That's an excellent idea  Yeah  if we chat  it will create the illusion of time going faster 
label1 Well  if it's not cholera  then based on a quick Internet search  the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease  botulism  a 30 - foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms 
label1 It's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24 - hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor  Oh  Lord  my belly !
label1 So this is how it ends  with cruel irony  Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body  I am betrayed by my appendix  a vestigial organ  Do you know the original purpose of the appendix  Leonard ?
label1 I do  And yet I'm doomed while you live on 
label1 Oh  Lord  I think it's about to burst !
label1 Good night  Appendicitis  What a nervous Nelly 
label1 Thank you  They're my mother's 
label1 What about your pedometer ?
label1 Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod ?
label1 What do you do  you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny ?
label1 Why are you doing that ?
label1 All right 
label1 I am doing it 
label1 We'll never know 
label1 Yeah  I've been reading up on biomechanics  I think you'll be surprised at my Wah ! Oh !
label1 Thank you 
label1 If it makes you feel any better  Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night 
label1 Coming !
label1 I'm behind you  Please look at me when you're talking to me 
label1 No  you're not  Pay no attention to that man in the bed 
label1 At my age  do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die ?
label1 An accident 
label1 Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container  my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed 
label1 You have to help  it's in the roommate agreement 
label1 I'm coming  Woz  I'm coming 
label1 All right  I'm ready for my next question 
label1 Uganda 
label1 Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses  A Central African power block is formed  colonizing North Africa and Europe  When war breaks out  no one can afford the luxury of a rhino  Kenya withers  Uganda triumphs 
label1 In a world where a piano is a weapon  not a musical instrument  on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag ?
label1 Defend 
label1 You're right  My apologies 
label1 It's a game we invented  It's called Counterfactuals 
label1 It's fun for ages eight to eighty  Join us 
label1 You're in luck  this is an easy one  In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver  what food is no longer consumed ?
label1 Leonard  be serious  We're playing a game here 
label1 Sorry we're late 
label1 I believe she's experiencing her menses 
label1 A juvenile amalgamation of our names  Sheldon and Amy  ' Shamy 
label1 I should've warned you  one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here 
label1 It's how they lure you in  I believe it's called bait and switch 
label1 They can't function without me  I'm the social glue that holds this little group together  You're welcome 
label1 She's not my girlfriend  She's a girl and she's my friend  but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva 
label1 Although  for the record  on one occasion  she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth  It's an action we both regret to this day 
label1 Yes  And I'd thank you to do the same 
label1 Greetings 
label1 I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing 
label1 Do I detect a hint of condescension ?
label1 Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac ?
label1 You take that back 
label1 Excuse me  but a grand unified theory  insofar as it explains everything  will ipso facto explain neurobiology 
label1 That's the rankest psychologism  and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s !
label1 I agree  I move our relationship terminate immediately 
label1 Regarding what ?
label1 I don't follow 
label1 Penny  I assure you  I'm fine  My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual  There were no emotional bonds  the severing of which would cause me any discomfort  The relationship simply outlived its utility  and I'm continuing on with my life as before 
label1 Oh  gentlemen 
label1 My apologies  Raj  Howard  I'd like you to meet Dr  Robert Oppenheimer 
label1 Now  if you'll excuse me  the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk 
label1 Yes  This is Enrico Fermi  Richard Feynman  Edward Teller  Otto Frisch  and Zazzles 
label1 Clowder 
label1 It's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one 
label1 I was there  She dumped you 
label1 You don't have to sell me on cats  Leonard  I'm already a fan  All right  fellas  who's in the mood for Fancy Feast ? Well  that's not fancy at all 
label1 Come in 
label1 Mom  what an unexpected pleasure 
label1 What are you doing here ?
label1 Oh  that's preposterous  I'm not pining over anyone 
label1 I do not agree  Cats make wonderful companions  They don't argue or question my intellectual authority  and this little guy here  I think you'll find to be quite zazzy 
label1 Coming !
label1 Well  rest assured  I am in full possession of my faculties 
label1 Yes  ma'am 
label1 That's a peculiar conclusion  By any standard  Amy is more similar to me than anyone I've ever met 
label1 Well  whether you see it or not is irrelevant  I can't see subatomic particles  but nevertheless  they're there 
label1 A physics point 
label1 Amy  after consideration  I believe we may have acted rashly  I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences 
label1 I'll go as high as 40 
label1 Done  You understand that moving forward  we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you ?
label1 Would you like to see my cats ?
label1 Ah  then you may find Zazzles a little cloying 
label1 Thank you  Amy  Here's your cat  And here's your $ 20 
label1 Yes  well  if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light  then you'd be correct  Also  pigs would fly  my derriere would produce cotton candy  and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic 
label1 You're wrong again  If my superpower were arrogance  my name would be Dr  Arroganto 
label1 Hello  I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened 
label1 Our collaboration is a work of the mind  We don't need desks 
label1 Correct 
label1 You're two for two 
label1 Oh  Lord  will this day never end ? As I've explained repeatedly to Dr  Koothrappali  whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient  there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture 
label1 That's ridiculous 
label1 It's my office 
label1 All right  all right  He can buy his own desk 
label1 They do some of their best work at night 
label1 One question 
label1 Why on earth are you telling me all this ?
label1 It's actually British 
label1 Brobdingnagian 
label1 Brobdingnagian 
label1 Brobdingnagian  Brobdingna How did you even get it in here ?
label1 All right  you've made your point  A fine prank  very amusing  Now get it out 
label1 All right  if you're not going to remove it  I'll remove it for you 
label1 Help me move my desk 
label1 Why do you even want this here ? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose 
label1 All right  I see what's going on  This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges  Well titted 
label1 I'm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas  Just a little experiment in pest control 
label1 Well  we'll just see how long you can hold out 
label1 Highly  Oh  dear 
label1 It'll also help improve her initial impression of you 
label1 Well  the status is as it always was  She's a girl  She's a friend  She is not my  please forgive me for doing this  girlfriend 
label1 Leonard  you are my best friend  I've known you for seven years  and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you  Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler 
label1 I sense judgment on your part 
label1 May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy 
label1 I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female  You have none 
label1 Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster  not unlike the Hulk  who  by the way  also has a girlfriend  In this iteration  Jennifer Connelly  whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind  a feel-good romp if there ever was one 
label1 Hu-u-urgh ! Leonard not jealous 
label1 You know  it just occurred to me  if there are an infinite number of parallel universes  in one of them  there's probably a Sheldon who doesn't believe parallel universes exist 
label1 Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman  and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity ?
label1 You know  when my grandfather died  and Meemaw was alone  my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people  It's very nice  They discuss current events  play bridge  get a hot meal 
label1 It is if you like bridge  Do you like bridge  Leonard ?
label1 It's not a home  It's a senior centre  We'd never put Meemaw in a home !
label1 All right  I'll bow to social pressure  Hey !
label1 No  no  no  no !
label1 Thank you 
label1 Leonard ? Are you sleeping ?
label1 Are you ill ?
label1 You're welcome  But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot 
label1 Since we got home from the comic bookstore 
label1 As per your suggestion  we're hanging out  Quite frankly  I don't see what all the hoopla's about  Go on  Amy 
label1 Wise decision  You see  Amy  success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height  strength  attractiveness  the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts  separately or together  Leonard has none of these attributes  right  Leonard ?
label1 Oh ! Good point  Amy  Yeah  building on your premise  Leonard could frequent sushi bars  salad bars  oyster bars  the Apple Genius Bar  what are you doing ?
label1 Let's make that our word of the day 
label1 Well  I have to void my bladder  It was nice spending this time with you 
label1 I see  Can I get back to you on that ?
label1 What does that mean ?
label1 Uh-huh 
label1 I don't want the next level  I like this level  Fix it for me !
label1 Simple ! You want a girlfriend  Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend  Take her off my hands  I give you my blessing 
label1 You're right  It would never work  Amy finds you tedious 
label1 Wait ! What am I supposed to do ?
label1 Leonard  I'm a physicist  not a hippie 
label1 Screwed 
label1 As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way  only with an absurd amount of hair gel 
label1 I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me and compel me to meet her mother 
label1 Exactly 
label1 Thank you  I've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address 
label1 She'll get lost  We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles  We now live at 311 Los Robles 
label1 The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan  Now  get my back  Jack 
label1 Tell her I'm not here 
label1 I don't know  You'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence  keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details 
label1 Way to go on the details 
label1 No misunderstanding  I've learned what that request actually means  and I don't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis 
label1 So we'd be perpetrating a ruse ?
label1 And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me ?
label1 Amy Farrah Fowler  that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me 
label1 Of course  Would you like to join me for Chinese food ?
label1 My apologies  Good night  Amy 
label1 I assure you I am quite real and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter 
label1 Oh  yes  We're like wild animals in heat  It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt 
label1 Agreed  Amy  I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship  Bazinga  Bedtime  Please show yourself out 
label1 Amusing  A play on the two meanings of cobbler 
label1 Excuse me  I object  You propose a guessing game  yet you don't give me enough time to guess  For the record  I was going to say your sister Priya 
label1 Why would I change ?
label1 Cobbler  I'm still laughing 
label1 The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City  a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car  Next stop  Travel Town  an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines  cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s  Finally  we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at  that's right  the Hollywood Carney's  a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car 
label1 Well then apparently  you hate fun 
label1 He rejected train day 
label1 Abundantly 
label1 That's what I said 
label1 Do you like trains ?
label1 You are in a forest  There is quicksand to the west  a path leads to the east  Go east  An iron gate blocks your way  Open gate  It's locked  Hmm  well  so much for that 
label1 I've found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s 
label1 Oh yes  It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip  imagination 
label1 Go north  You can't go that way  Go west  A troll blocks your passage  Okay  fasten your seatbelts  kill troll  With what ? With sword 
label1 Hit troll with axe  Hit troll with axe  Hit troll with axe  Oh my  this is one tough troll 
label1 Leonard  I'm trapped in quicksand  the axe is dragging me down 
label1 Drop axe  Brilliant 
label1 Hold on  I have to figure out how to get the bucket  so I can carry the mud past the dragon 
label1 I know 
label1 Five more minutes 
label1 Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula 
label1 No  But it's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated  Who was at the door ?
label1 That's unacceptable  We're supposed to be given written notice 
label1 Well  what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change  only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak 
label1 I know how to get the bucket ! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it  Let's see  Go north  You are in a forest  Go north  You are in a forest  Go north  You are in a forest  Oh dear  I believe I'm lost  Well  I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow 
label1 Oh  Well  good job  quite convincing  I smell perfume 
label1 And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck 
label1 My sympathies  I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis  Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection ?
label1 Very well  I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch 
label1 Do you prefer ointment or cream ?
label1 With or without a numbing agent ?
label1 Really ? Leonard  there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis 
label1 Prescription or non-prescription strength 
label1 Excellent choice 
label1 Priya ?
label1 What do you want to talk about ?
label1 There it is  What if someone asks ?
label1 Perhaps  But they might ask me something else 
label1 Like  has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently ?
label1 And Raj 
label1 Violation of the roommate agreement  overnight guest notification clause 
label1 You're far too short to be Darth Vader  At best you might be a turncoat Ewok 
label1 You mean  you want me to keep a secret 
label1 You know I can't keep a secret 
label1 Why do you get to be Batman ?
label1 Well Alfred has secrets too 
label1 Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl  Which I've now just told to Batman  See  I can't keep a secret 
label1 Ta-da  It's short for da-da-da-da !
label1 I know  that's why I shortened it 
label1 I came to go over your alibi for last night 
label1 You've asked me to lie on your behalf  and as you know  I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest  so I've provided you with an iron clad alibi  You couldn't have spent last night with Priya  because you were with another woman 
label1 The fun loving  and morally loose  Miss Maggie McGeary 
label1 You met her at Pasadena's most popular Irish watering hole  Lucky Baldwin's  where Maggie spends her nights tending bar  with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams 
label1 And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this 
label1 It's pretty convincing  huh ? And it wasn't even a real person  And here is the clincher  A lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair 
label1 From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab 
label1 Well  no-one's going to run a DNA test on it  Leonard  honestly you over-think everything 
label1 And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation  Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship  And with that  I will re-zip my lip 
label1 Oh  I've heard of that place  isn't that Pasadena's favourite Irish watering hole 
label1 Did you meet anyone interesting there  perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid ?
label1 Sure you can  you're doing fine  it's very believable 
label1 Don't listen to him  he's still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system 
label1 I believe they engaged in coitus but  more importantly  if Leonard had not abandoned his story  would you have found it plausible ?
label1 May I point out  in a parallel universe  your friends are saying Maggie McGeary  she sounds lovely 
label1 I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving 
label1 Well  excuse me  That was not a betrayal  that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy 
label1 For science 
label1 You used my toothbrush ?
label1 With real puffing smoke ?
label1 You're so close 
label1 Mango  caterpillar  What are you doing ? You said you liked it !
label1 The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family 
label1 Nothing  It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation 
label1 Excuse me  If we're changing topics  I believe I have first dibs with capybara  a rodent the size of a baby hippo 
label1 Not particularly 
label1 I suppose I could if I were asked 
label1 Of course  Why do you have to make things so complicated ?
label1 You say you're Special Agent Page  FBI 
label1 For the record  I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto ?
label1 Correct  Now to business  18 years ago  I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis  Why haven't I heard back yet ?
label1 A little  but go on 
label1 I'm going to answer that with a visual aid  This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set  Mr  Wolowitz borrowed it  damaged plastic retention hub number three  and then returned it to me  hoping I wouldn't notice  Would you characterize that as responsible ?
label1 Very well  Would you be interested in knowing that Mr  Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level - 80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor ?
label1 Did I say Mars Rover ?
label1 That was actually a poorly chosen example  as it had nothing to do with me 
label1 I don't want to  Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz's culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars 
label1 Oh  good  I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident 
label1 Sleep eludes me  Leonard 
label1 Mockery ? That's all you have to offer ?
label1 Interesting  So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience 
label1 Excuse me ?
label1 Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis ?
label1 That seems fairly conclusive 
label1 Yes  I'd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour  Howard Joel Wolowitz  H is for honesty  of which he has much  O's for outstanding  which he is such  W's for witty  he's quick with a joke  A's for artistic  his ability '
label1 I don't understand why you people are picking on my friend  Howard  when there are much more serious security threats to pursue  For instance  when I first met Leonard  he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy  and not one agent ever investigated that 
label1 No  it's a different Leonard  He's Chinese  red hair  six fingers  Good-bye 
label1 Raj  Have you seen Howard ?
label1 I'm quite familiar with Dr  Tyson  He's responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status  I liked Pluto  Ergo I do not like you 
label1 Yes  but before you get upset  I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement 
label1 No  If anything  I made it worse  In any case  I have been riddled with guilt  which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep  So  I'm here now to say I'm sorry 
label1 Yes  I followed the social protocol  I attempted to right the wrong  and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology  Now you say apology accepted  and I will offer you a one-time-only high five 
label1 You're tricking me  It really is  isn't it ?
label1 Oh  shut up 
label1 I have troubles  Penny  I've come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep 
label1 I don't like the Olive Garden  They treat me like family 
label1 Alcohol 
label1 Ethyl alcohol  40 millilitres 
label1 Ah  Blame President James ' Jimmy Carter  He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up  He wonders why he was a one-term president 
label1 More or less 
label1 I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail  Fortunately  thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics  there's an app for that  Let's see  Harvey Wallbanger  Eh  Sex on the Beach  I hardly think so  Rob Roy  Silk Slipper  Mad Hatter  Ooh ! I'll have a Rosewater Ricky 
label1 You'll need pitted  brandied cherries  gin  rosewater  angostura bitters and overproofed rum  Now  first  dust the cherries with sugar  then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters  Then ignite the rum  caramel '
label1 That's not how it looks in the picture 
label1 All right  To the metric system 
label1 I wronged Howard  and he won't accept my apology 
label1 Penny  you face failure on a daily basis  How do you cope ?
label1 To drinking 
label1 Impressive that you know that  It's hard to believe I'm actually having this conversation with you 
label1 Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator  That's it 
label1 I'll reprogram Howard 
label1 No  you can't reprogram people  To James Tiberius Kirk 
label1 Hello  all 
label1 Yes  you are  I'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns 
label1 There's a nine ninety five e-book down the drain 
label1 It's for Howard 
label1 Nevertheless  I've hurt you  and whether you forgive me or not  I want you to have this 
label1 No  I love my mother  My feelings for my spot are much greater  It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe  And now it's yours 
label1 High five  Not too hard  Thank you 
label1 I changed my mind  Get out of my spot 
label1 That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman  She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson's Thriller video  which I've never viewed in its entirety  as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible  And also  it's really scary 
label1 There's no switch  Just listen and learn 
label1 Because the print they're showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage 
label1 May I point out to you all that the screening is first come  first served ?
label1 Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight  and it's already five o'clock  Let's go 
label1 Drat  Now I'm 8 for 27 
label1 What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek : Nemesis ?
label1 But how were our seats ?
label1 Shrewd 
label1 Wait  now  we don't know that yet  He isn't finished  I have a girlfriend and you don't who ?
label1 Knock-knock 
label1 Hugh people need to listen to me  It's time to get in line for the movie  And that's how you tell a knock-knock joke 
label1 Under normal circumstances I'd say  I told you so  But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already  the phrase has lost all meaning  Therefore  I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly 
label1 I informed you thusly 
label1 This is where we could have been if we hadn't stopped for dinner  This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert 
label1 And here's where we are  The runts in a large litter  unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones 
label1 What did he say ?
label1 We might not get seats ?
label1 Oh  I informed you thusly  I so informed you thusly 
label1 Well  if it isn't Wil Wheaton  the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe 
label1 Of what ? Poorly executed beards ?
label1 This is Indiana Jones  not Star Trek  There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here  And even at Star Trek conventions  they only let him in if he helps set up 
label1 I will not calm down  This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered  As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said  the line must be drawn here ! This far  no farther !
label1 Listen to what Mr  Wil Wheaton is tweeting  Best seats in house for Raiders screening  Suck on that  Sheldon Cooper 
label1 I believe in knowing my enemy  Leonard  Had Twitter existed at the time  would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull ? Would not Lee have followed Grant ? Would not Spy have followed Spy ? I have more examples  but excuse me 
label1 Munching on complimentary popcorn  Woot  woot  Oh  the gall  I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea  choking to death  woot  woot 
label1 You know what ? I'm going back to I told you so  I told you so 
label1 Raiders of the Lost Ark  with 21 additional seconds  If I can't see it  no one else can see it 
label1 Trouble is my middle name  Leonard  Actually  it's Lee  but I prefer Trouble 
label1 Don't worry  Wil Wheaton  I was just leaving  ' Da-da-da-da  da-da-da !
label1 Da-da-da-da  da-da-da !
label1 Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one ?
label1 Now you just being silly  Wolverine's never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer 
label1 Are you sure you have enough comics ? You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours  and by my estimate  you've only selected seven hours of reading material  That's even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt 
label1 I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly  I prefer the classics  regular and Klingon 
label1 You went out in the hallway  stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5000 years into the future  where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine  and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins ?
label1 Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results  By that standard  Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs 
label1 If it'll make you feel better  we rarely listen 
label1 Oh  friggety-frak  Not this again 
label1 Include me in what ? Is there a plot afoot ? I'll have no truck with plots 
label1 Uh  we don't discuss anything  Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement  As such  he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines 
label1 Yes  If Penny's going to be spending nights here again  you'll need to set up an escrow account  Sign here 
label1 Do you even think about other people  Leonard ? Do you ?
label1 I'm going to propose a hypothesis  Last night  Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret 
label1 That sounds rehearsed  We are not alone 
label1 Clarify something for me  Isn't the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions ? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day ?
label1 Well  we could argue about who said what all night long  but to set things back on course  I will propose a new topic of conversation 
label1 What is the best number ? By the way  there's only one correct answer 
label1 Wrong  The best number is 73  You're probably wondering why 
label1 73 is the 21st prime number  Its mirror  37  is the 12th  and its mirror  21  is the product of multiplying  hang on to your hats  seven and three  Eh ? Eh ? Did I lie ?
label1 Chuck Norris wishes  In binary  73 is a palindrome  one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one  exactly the same  All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc 
label1 Aren't you slicing that man's brain a little too thin ?
label1 Well  you're the expert  If the correct way to do it is the wrong way  then I yield 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity ? I did that one summer  Ah  youth 
label1 I'd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis 
label1 Localized to what region ?
label1 Then why did you ask ?
label1 All right  let's start over  What did you say when Zack walked in ?
label1 Because you keep saying who 
label1 All right  I think I have enough to go on  Possible explanations for your symptoms are  in descending order of likelihood  hyperthyroidism  premature menopause  hosting an alien parasite or  and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases  sexual arousal 
label1 Are you sure ? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy 
label1 Hang on  I don't know that we've given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake 
label1 Star Trek  Did you see Star Trek : The Motion Picture ?
label1 Don't  It's terrible  However  in it  we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half  he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar 
label1 Cheap science fiction ?
label1 Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment 
label1 I hadn't considered that  Give me a moment  All right  I've considered it 
label1 I reject it 
label1 Oh  As they were incorrectly sliced  you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi 
label1 The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener  If this one under or over-softens  I'll need time to make things right 
label1 The alternative would be to think backwards  And that's just remembering 
label1 Amy's changed  I might have to let her go 
label1 I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect  like me  But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges  Like you 
label1 What insult ?
label1 Forget science  She's horny 
label1 It's simple biology  There's nothing I can do about it 
label1 What are you suggesting ?
label1 It's illegal to spay a human being 
label1 Oh  Oh ! You mean something I could do 
label1 Well  I was hoping to avoid this  But I might as well get it over with  Thank you  Penny  I'll let you know what happens 
label1 Yes  This is Dr  Sheldon Cooper  Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny ? Sorry to bother you  Hello  I'm looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny  Coitus  It means intercourse  And I have a feeling I'm speaking to the right Zack  This is Sheldon Cooper  Fine  Shelly  Yes  that does sound like a girl's name  No  it doesn't bother me  Yes  Smelly Shelly does bother me  Let me tell you why I'm calling  I'd like to know if you'd be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler  Amy Farrah Fowler  Yes  that is a girl's name  Good grief  It's like trying to talk to a dolphin 
label1 Look at this stamp  On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter ?
label1 Are you sure this is what you want to do ?
label1 Go  Amy Farrah Fowler  Follow your endocrine system 
label1 Please don't drag this out  This is never going to come off 
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 Yes  Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work 
label1 No  although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool 
label1 Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts ? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon 
label1 Oh  that's easy enough  We'd need a large tank of water  a hoop to jump through  and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty 
label1 That's not correct  We were implying it  You then inferred it 
label1 Zack  I'm sorry you're stupid  Have a Milk Dud 
label1 That's very hurtful 
label1 Milk Dud ?
label1 Literally ? Literally a million years ?
label1 In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls  where they belong 
label1 Of course  We're coming as the Justice League of America 
label1 To that point  it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link  which is clearly Leonard as Superman 
label1 That's sad  Let's ask ourselves  is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton ?
label1 I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica 
label1 Why not ? Penny did it 
label1 Congratulations  Zack  how would you like to be Superman ?
label1 Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth  Invisible plane sold separately 
label1 Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes  She isn't the free spirit I am 
label1 We're going to be late  I'm pacing nervously 
label1 This is how the Flash paces 
label1 I'm not Sheldon  I'm the Flash  And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration  I'm back 
label1 Oh  I hardly think so  The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he's running late 
label1 I'm sorry  But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde ?
label1 I'm the Flash  I just knocked 30000 times 
label1 I understand why you're upset 
label1 Yes  You're afraid that costume makes you look fat 
label1 Don't worry  Wonder Woman was an Amazon  And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals 
label1 But they're not blonde  so put on your wig  Hello ?
label1 I may have failed 
label1 Obviously  we're no longer a Justice League  We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes 
label1 Yes  And make her wear the black wig  Good luck 
label1 Thank you ! Thank you so much !
label1 No  wait ! I have a speech 
label1 This is my moment  dag nab it !
label1 We're the Justice League of America  There's only one thing we can do  Turn around and slowly walk away 
label1 I won't say that all senior citizens who can't master technology should be publicly flogged  but if we made an example of one or two  it might give the others incentive to try harder 
label1 Howard doesn't  He's only an engineer 
label1 You know  Leonard  that's actually a valid idea  Very good 
label1 No  The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable  though if pressed  I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat  I'll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer  I agree to be part of your project  Congratulations 
label1 You have so few good ideas  Leonard  And you're just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider ?
label1 Of Texas 
label1 Hardly  Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario  A young woman alone in the big city  Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her 
label1 Then it hits her  How is she going to survive ? I mean  she has no prospects  no marketable skills  And then one day  she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard 
label1 She befriends them  and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea  which she steals and sells to the highest bidder 
label1 Oh  is it ? Well let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time 
label1 All right  I've taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app 
label1 A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres 
label1 Duly noted  Steve from Wichita 
label1 Oh  of course you are  Look at the organizational chart  You're clearly listed as founder 
label1 You missed Chief Science Officer  Chairman of the Board  and Head of the Secret Santa Committee 
label1 All right  All right  I'm not going to argue with you  Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player  Dr  Hofstadter  you have the conn 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  we're doomed 
label1 Good one  boss 
label1 This diagram  I assume you were opening with a joke  It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps 
label1 In that case  may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing ?
label1 Oh  I'm  I'm sorry  I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees  but I realize now  you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men 
label1 How about this for the app name ? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator 
label1 Does it ? A happy accident 
label1 Well  but hear me out  The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project  Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago  For our app  I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs 
label1 Another happy accident 
label1 I see  Is that decision open for discussion ?
label1 When in the course of human events  it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together '
label1 All right  let's get right to the vote  Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny 
label1 Really ? Why ?
label1 Oh  Good morning  shoemaker  I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night 
label1 But I made it better 
label1 Well  that speaks volumes  doesn't it ? All right  I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants 
label1 Except you identified me  your best friend  as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away  The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex 
label1 Good morning  Friend Howard  Friend Raj  I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages  Perhaps they would taste better out of these 
label1 Don't thank me  You earned it 
label1 I'm sorry  I typed that into the label maker  but I just couldn't press enter  Now down to business  What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company ? Unless  of course  the mugs are sufficient  in which case  welcome aboard 
label1 I understand  And your loyalty is admirable  But what if I were to up the ante ?
label1 Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer  No ? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot ? Go  Beavers  I'll be back 
label1 Greetings  gentlemen  How goes your little project ?
label1 Ah  a combination of all your names  Very clever  I assume Koothranardowitz was taken ?
label1 Oh  well then  by all means  carry on  I wouldn't want to impede your progress 
label1 Playing the theremin 
label1 Playing it  I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme  And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet  gathering dust 
label1 That's all right  I can barely hear you over my theremin 
label1 Don't beat around the bush  Leonard  If you don't want me here  just say the word  and I'll leave 
label1 I'm practicing my theremin 
label1 Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment  And his app team 
label1 He wouldn't drive me to work today  I had to wear my bus pants 
label1 Yes  And they're still sticky 
label1 Probably going to have to throw them away 
label1 With you ?
label1 Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress ?
label1 That's your app idea ?
label1 Oh  Penny  where do I begin ? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality 
label1 I know  it's baffling 
label1 Real cocoa ?
label1 Do you have those little marshmallows ?
label1 Well  I suppose it's appropriate 
label1 A disappointing drink for a disappointing day 
label1 Really ? Leonard wants me back ?
label1 Well  we sure saw that coming 
label1 Oh  no  Mrs  Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars 
label1 I was being sarcastic 
label1 Oh  by the way  thank you for the delicious cocoa 
label1 Boy  I'm getting good at this 
label1 Before you begin  let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership 
label1 As a result  you have taken the most important step on the road to success  learning what not to do  Now  let's start fresh  Howard  we're going to need some tea 
label1 Algorithm  You see  Penny  Alan Turing defined an algorithm '
label1 Probably serving food that was ordered today 
label1 In order to take a vacation  one first has to work 
label1 I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness  '
label1 You lied to me ?
label1 Raj ? What are you doing ? I don't think so  You've had your allotted six ounces  The first bathroom break isn't until the Denny's located near Bakersfield  which is approximately two and half hours away  Remember  people  we're only as strong as our weakest bladder 
label1 All right  We have seven people  and two cars  In the lead car  driven by Leonard  will be myself  Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny 
label1 She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere  your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild 
label1 Red Leader to Red Five  come in  Red Leader to Red Five  come in  Howard  you promised 
label1 It's eleven fifteen  I'm requesting your quarter-hourly location update 
label1 Copy that  Red Five  Radio contact is sufficient  No need to extend your middle finger 
label1 Indeed  Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine 
label1 No  Amy ?
label1 Amy  it's Penny's turn  Penny ?
label1 That's not apropos  We've already established I'm found in the periodic table 
label1 Can you guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night ?
label1 Howard is a complete and total ass  Bernadette is in Penny's bed  Amy bites  and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard 
label1 Good morning and welcome to Science and Society  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  BS  MS  MA  PhD  and ScD  OMG  right ? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd  All right then  we'll begin with opening remarks  Miss Rostenkowski  would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science's responsibility to society ?
label1 Dr  Koothrappali  would you care to join the conversation ?
label1 Excuse me  We're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet 
label1 I guess not 
label1 All right  why don't we open it up to Q & A from the audience ?
label1 All right  if no one's going to guess  I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back 
label1 Good evening  I'm your guest lecturer  Dr  Sheldon Cooper  I was expecting applause  but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate  I agreed to speak to you this evening  because I was told that you're the best and the brightest of this university's doctoral candidates  Hmm  Of course  that's like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom  ' Cause  you see  there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom  Best and brightest  my sweet patootie  All right  let's begin  Show of hands  who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators ? Don't kid yourselves 
label1 Oh  yes  you should have seen those young people  Thirsty for knowledge  drinking in my wisdom  I may have changed a few lives today 
label1 Oh  tweets about my lecture  Hmm  That's rather unfair  That's downright cruel  Plus  insects have six legs  Yeah  I'm not familiar with the acronym KMN 
label1 Well  I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion  I think I'll turn in  I didn't want to teach those poopy heads  anyway 
label1 It's a charming illusion  but it does not cheer me up 
label1 Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989 ?
label1 For instance ?
label1 Hmm  no  One slip of the hand  and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department  building doodads with Wolowitz 
label1 Isn't that their burden ? I'm the one with something interesting to say 
label1 I sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany  Would you mind very much jumping to it ?
label1 Acting lessons  Interesting  It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn 
label1 You're an
label1 All right  You're an actress  I need you to teach me 
label1 So  when could we start ?
label1 I suppose that's one way to look at it 
label1 Oh  I'm sorry  I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road 
label1 I'll pay you 40 dollars 
label1 Nothing  I was acting 
label1 Yes  In preparation for today's studies  I read Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares  Stella Adler's
label1 How shall we begin ?
label1 Penny  my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool  wary distance from each other 
label1 You're the teacher 
label1 Gotcha 
label1 All right 
label1 Hey  you taught me something  Who would have thought it ?
label1 I'd like a frozen yogurt  please 
label1 You do ?
label1 All right  Yes  I see a sign  It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital 
label1 You have any frozen yogurt ?
label1 Yes  I didn't care for it 
label1 So is the McRib sandwich  I don't care for that  either 
label1 I'm glad you asked  I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play 
label1 Why don't we leave that for future generations to decide ?
label1 It's the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century  where his genius is not only appreciated  but celebrated 
label1 Now  in this pivotal scene  Sheldon's mother  played by you  argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets  Mr  Spock  the role I will bring to life 
label1 Why would we want to do that ? It's called the comfort zone for a reason 
label1 I'm sorry  You'll be Spock ?
label1 Very well  I'll set the scene 
label1 East Texas  A warm summer night  A woman  Mary  stands on a porch  In the distance  we hear a lonesome train whistle  Woo-woo  The droning buzz of cicadas  Zzzzzzzzz  A coyote howls at the moon  frightening sensitive young boys everywhere  Aw-aw-aw ! Out in the woods  an owl screeches 
label1 Shelly ! Shelly  how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch ? Goodness  I'll never understand that boy  But then again  I'm a religious nut  and my mind is closed to so many things 
label1 Glory be to Heaven  some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air  George  put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin no one  and get your shotgun !
label1 I'm sorry  I just don't buy it 
label1 Oh  my  your sudden appearance startles me 
label1 I understand  Oh  Shelly ? A man's here to take you away to the future ! Be sure to pack clean underwear  '
label1 I'm sorry  I just love that line  Even the way you do it 
label1 Oh  Shelly ? A man's here to take you away to the future  Be sure to pack clean underwear 
label1 Mommy  why are you crying ? ' Cause I'm gonna miss you  Shelly-bean  even though you creep the bejeezus out of me 
label1 Mommy  I love you  Don't let Spock take me to the future !
label1 Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V  who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them  to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects  Course  if he'd have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I've sent him on the subject of his administration  he could have saved himself the trouble 
label1 That depends  how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder ?
label1 It's not a touch phobia  it's a germ phobia  If you'd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves 
label1 Hold on  Just because the nice man is offering you candy  doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van  What's the occasion ?
label1 Aha ! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van 
label1 I don't care  it's demeaning  And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair  Which  by the way  is something you don't want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign's uniform 
label1 Tell him Dr  Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God 
label1 Don't tell him that  tell him the mask thing 
label1 And so  instead of bowing to pressure  and going to that pointless soiree  I stayed right here and did a load of whites 
label1 Unlikely  But make your case  Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together  and I'm not above minimizing your window 
label1 That's it  Prepare to be minimized 
label1 Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante ?
label1 Oh  dear  not  not the dirt people !
label1 Oh  the humanities !
label1 An entire dinner to talk about your research ? Where you going  the drive-thru at Jack in the Box ?
label1 Okay  I see what's happening 
label1 My stature intimidates her  so she's using you to get to me  Crafty old gal 
label1 You know  it's a shame  all that work she's doing to get sober  only to be torn apart and eaten alive 
label1 No  But we have potatoes  I could make you vodka  It'll take two weeks 
label1 Oh  wow !
label1 Excellent ! What are you planning to wear ?
label1 Penny  you're an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain  walk him through this 
label1 Well  come now  Leonard  this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science !
label1 Just a few things you may need tonight  There's  uh  baby oil  condoms and  uh  a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology  They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M & M 
label1 Oh  come on ! Why not ?
label1 Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse  you might consider  just this once  using your genitalia to actually accomplish something !
label1 No  But thank you for asking 
label1 What's going on ?
label1 Are you just getting home ?
label1 She stiffed you ?
label1 Smart  Get paid up front  Yeah  I think you have a real knack for gigolo work  Leonard 
label1 That's a good idea  get your rest  There are a lot more rich old ladies out there  and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator  And I thought he didn't learn anything from his relationship with you 
label1 Another compliment ! Learn to recognize them 
label1 What's going on ?
label1 Did you offer him a hot beverage ?
label1 Leonard  social protocol states when a friend is upset  you offer them a hot beverage  such as tea 
label1 You heard the man  Leonard  And while you're at it  I'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest  so make me cocoa  Point of inquiry  given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend  why didn't you seek refuge under his roof ?
label1 Cocoa  Leonard  Focus  I'm down in the dumps here 
label1 Don't worry  As your tertiary friend  I am prepared to step in and comfort you 
label1 No  no  I'll finish making the tea  while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever's troubling you 
label1 That's what tertiary friends are for 
label1 Would you be sleeping over again this evening ? Because you're welcome to 
label1 Actually  he can  The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters  If a woman's father is not around  the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family  in this case  Raj  The code also states that if she disobeys  she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases  If true  that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard 
label1 Priya  if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness  it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to  if I may quote Howard  do the dance with no pants 
label1 No  no  It's not an imposition  At this point  in our ecosystem  you are akin to the plover  a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles  Please  fly into our open maw  and have at it 
label1 Did you get the part ?
label1 Given the state of your career  can you really afford to be picky ?
label1 It's actually Thai  You're slipping 
label1 They went to Catalina for the weekend 
label1 At home  forbidding it 
label1 Actually  it's the three of us 
label1 Right  I'll make tea 
label1 I'm sorry  It's not optional 
label1 Buona sera  Luigi's Pizza  Buona sera  It means good evening in Italian  May I say  having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante ?
label1 Un momento  Oh  for heaven's sake  now you're being deliberately stupid 
label1 But tonight's Thursday  On Thursdays  everybody comes over here and has pizza  Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi  but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan 
label1 We could  We could also stop using the letter M  but I think that idea is isguided and oronic 
label1 Well  I don't want to go to a party 
label1 I'm sorry  but five people eating and chatting is a party 
label1 Because we don't throw parties 
label1 Well  no  sir  and do you know why ? In a word  tradition  Every Thursday night for the last eight years  you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce  discuss the issues of the day  and yes  share a laugh or two  But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you 
label1 Wait ! Leonard ! Wait ! What am I going to do for dinner ?
label1 But what if he does ? I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach  And frankly  blood pudding is essentially the same thing  I don't know why he's serving both 
label1 No  I'll go to your haggis party  But I'm telling you  this is adness  This is utter and coplete adness 
label1 Oh  dear !
label1 The audible sigh is a show of exasperation  right ?
label1 Is it about me or the dead pixels ?
label1 Oh  Indians making Tex-Mex  Might as well have had the Chinese pizza 
label1 Oh  what fun  We're like hippies at a love-in 
label1 Wonderful  Dinner  some assembly required 
label1 A margarita ? Where are we ? What is happening ?
label1 Water  Neat  With a little umbrella 
label1 Sadly  Penny  this evening  I am the Dark Knight  roaming these mean streets alone  A windbreaker for my cape  and a stern expression for my cowl 
label1 Excuse me ? Isn't this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron ?
label1 I don't think your heart's in it  but since you asked  Apparently  because Leonard is dating Raj's sister  we're all forced to hang out at his apartment 
label1 Wonder what she's exasperated about  Hello ?
label1 Don't worry  My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking 
label1 Cluck-cluck-cluck 
label1 Leonard the nucleus ? That makes no sense  I'm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time 
label1 I'm setting out snacks 
label1 I didn't say the snacks were for you now  did I  Nosy Rosie ?
label1 Possibly  I Tweeted him 
label1 Leonard 
label1 We had a good run  you and I 
label1 But change is a part of life 
label1 Don't make this harder than it is  Leonard 
label1 And good-bye to you  sir  He'll be back 
label1 Well  it would appear LeVar Burton won't be joining us so let's get started  Um  I thought we'd begin by going around the room  introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we're here  Okay  I'm Sheldon  Uh  for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics  I need no introduction  If you're not familiar with that publication  there's a free copy in your goody bag  Stuart ?
label1 Patience  patience  Barry  The whaffle the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly 
label1 Yes  you must be present to win 
label1 Question  Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub ?
label1 Jacuzzi is a commercial brand  Hot tub is the generic term  i  e   all Jacuzzis are hot tubs  but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis 
label1 Of course it did  It's said that Archimedes  the ancient Greek mathematician  discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath 
label1 Forgive me  but I think you'll find my story is more interesting 
label1 Better  It has a gold crown  You see  the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution  Because the crown was irregularly shaped  there was no way to mathematically determine its volume  But  while bathing  Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose 
label1 When he finished  he shouted Eureka !
label1 I'm unhappy 
label1 Thank you 
label1 I had to leave  They were having fun wrong 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Then it's not chili  Real chili has no beans in it  but you're from a foreign land  so your ignorance is forgiven 
label1 Yes  please  Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered 
label1 Priya  do you know why this is called a toast ?
label1 She's also a bit of a know-it-all  Mmm  This is good  Whatever it is 
label1 Howard  if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice  Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time ? Granted  you're just an engineer  but that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else's Nobel prize acceptance speech 
label1 It's not cool  It's a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons  How'd you do it ?
label1 Fine  Give me a second 
label1 It's not amazing  All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet 
label1 Well  I don't care how you did it  I have more important things to think about  Clearly  the cards are marked 
label1 I do  You just happen to have caught me on a break  Oh  let me see those cards 
label1 Not knowing is part of the fun  Was that the motto of your community college ?
label1 This deck is rigged in some fashion 
label1 Oh  oh  please  if I don't know  you don't know  That's axiomatic 
label1 I think I figured out Wolowitz's magic trick  and I need you to pick a card 
label1 As you wish 
label1 Pick a card  Sheldon  Now look at it  and put it back in the deck  Now do you remember your card ? Of course I do  I have an eidetic memory  My apologies  Now shuffle the cards  Shuffling  Wait here  Processing image  cross-referencing 
label1 I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick 
label1 I'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one's been touched  By the way  if you hope to have children  I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers  Your testicles look a tad warm 
label1 Yes  I'm using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns 
label1 Relax  we're not under attack right now 
label1 And is this my card ? Rats ! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer  Where am I going to find Uranium - 235 this time of night ? Come on  Craigslist 
label1 Oh  yes  In fact  I improved upon it 
label1 All right  Pick a card 
label1 Bippity-boppity-boo 
label1 The wand is called showmanship  and the beep is none of your business  Oh ! Excuse me  I'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick  Oh  look  my dry cleaning's ready  And your card was the five of spades  Ta-da 
label1 Figure out the magic trick yet ?
label1 Hang on  This time do it with me  so I can make sure there's no monkey business 
label1 I hate you 
label1 They stole everything  Leonard  everything 
label1 What didn't they get ? They got my enchanted weapons  my vicious gladiator armour  my wand of untainted power  and all my gold 
label1 What choice did I have ? The mighty Sheldor  level 85 blood elf  hero of the Eastern kingdoms  has been picked clean  like a carcass in the desert sun  Plus  the FBI hung up on me 
label1 They took my battle ostrich 
label1 Yes  Glenn ! The only bird I ever loved 
label1 Wait a minute ! You're not going to do anything ?
label1 Doctor Cooper 
label1 That's from Avatar  World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth  Goodness gracious  how are you allowed to carry a gun ? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop ?
label1 You know  one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules  and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice ?
label1 It's all gone  All gone 
label1 What kind of world do we live in  where a man would take another man's battle ostrich ?
label1 This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity  It is time to cry havoc  and let slip the dogs of war 
label1 See if Raj is done with Pilates 
label1 Three thousand hours  Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse  collecting weapons and gold  It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time 
label1 Can we trust him ?
label1 No  Glenn's was leather  He was a simple ostrich  Is ! Is  I haven't given up hope 
label1 That game ? Excuse me  Penny  but Doodle Jump is a game  Angry Birds is a game  World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing all right  technically it's a game 
label1 Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich 
label1 Be ruthless  You tell him if he doesn't start talking  we'll register a complaint with his Internet service provider 
label1 I don't care ! I'm losin it  man !
label1 And people think I don't get sarcasm 
label1 I've never said these words before  but good job  Howard !
label1 The name and the address drip with evil 
label1 Excellent ! It's in a cul-de-sac  We can box him in 
label1 Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away 
label1 I don't know if you've been following the news  Leonard  but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture 
label1 Of course you did  It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work  But the bullies took it from us  Well  no more  Tonight  we take back our dignity  our birthright and our pride  What do you say ? Who's with me ?
label1 Fine  Leonard ?
label1 One moment 
label1 I'm sorry  I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother 
label1 That's uncanny 
label1 Sea World is better  It has Shamu  who is literally tons of fun  But for the moment  let's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki 
label1 I almost feel sorry for the poor fool  sitting in his split-level suburban ranch  unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour  Ease up there  lead foot  You trying to get us killed ?
label1 We are winged fury ! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit 
label1 I always prefer the train 
label1 Coming 
label1 No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth 
label1 So my blade shall not taste blood tonight ?
label1 Can I at least kick down the door ?
label1 Good point  Basket of puppies 
label1 Are you Todd Zarnecki ?
label1 I am Sheldor of Azeroth  I want my things back 
label1 Careful  That's a collectible 
label1 Well  he's even more cunning than we thought 
label1 Of course 
label1 It'd be swell if they had a train 
label1 Thank you  Penny 
label1 Todd Zarnecki was mean 
label1 We did it ! I said  we 
label1 Hysterical 
label1 Agreed  Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd  You may actually believe you're in a comedy club 
label1 Ba-dum-bump 
label1 Really  Amy ? Gossip ? I'm disappointed in you 
label1 Forgive my language  but poppycock 
label1 Fine  In the parlance of the urban music scene  what's the 4-1- 1 ?
label1 I believe our nation's tuna cans are safe  Excuse me  Dr  Greene  question ?
label1 You've dedicated your life's work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas 
label1 Have you ever considered trying to do something useful ? Perhaps  reading to the elderly ?
label1 Yeah  but not your books  Something they might enjoy  I kid  of course  Big fan 
label1 Thank you  My father taught me archery as a child  It's odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon 
label1 I know  What an elf I would have made  Whoo  what do you think you're doing ?
label1 With what ?
label1 Leonard  the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience  We have to do our part  too 
label1 She was attempting to engage me in gossip 
label1 Yes  I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie 
label1 Oh  please  I was just pointing it out  I have no desire to engage in the activity 
label1 All right  get this  Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard 
label1 Mm  it's hard to say  I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents marriage implode  In that case  the woman dives into religion  while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures  Oop ! Out of arrows 
label1 I've been thinking about Dr  Greene's efforts to make science palatable for the masses 
label1 That's all  I've just been thinking about it  Now  I'm thinking about fractal equations  Now I'm thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought  Now I'm thinking about trains 
label1 Now I'm thinking about Jell-O 
label1 Why are you smiling ?
label1 Oh  I'm back to trains  Woo-woo 
label1 Have you learned anything ?
label1 If you don't mind  I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking 
label1 Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette 
label1 I'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology  At Johnson Elementary School  the phrase Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire 
label1 It's one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don't find repellent 
label1 Interesting  A friendly sentiment in this country  cruel taunt in the Sudan  It's a lesson in context 
label1 Yes  I believe so 
label1 Yes  Why do you ask ?
label1 Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun  tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock ?
label1 Well  we may never know  As my mother would say  the Asians are an inscrutable folk  Now  if you'll excuse me  I have work to do 
label1 Did you get that ?
label1 This is moving faster than we thought 
label1 Pun intended ?
label1 This is remarkable  Took less than 24 hours 
label1 Interesting  So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow  as it were 
label1 I'm sorry  What pun ?
label1 I wish you hadn't done that  That's going to make me a chick magnet  and I'm so busy as it is 
label1 Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love 
label1 Leonard  are you in the shower ?
label1 I asked if you were in the shower  but that's moot now 
label1 Moot  Rendered unimportant by recent events 
label1 I have to skip the chitchat  Emergency 
label1 Mathematical  32 - ounce banana smoothie  16 - ounce bladder 
label1 I assure you I do 
label1 What are you doing in there ? She can't be in here 
label1 According to the roommate agreement  paragraph nine  subsection B  the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure  And believe me  I am experiencing a very majeure force 
label1 Come on  you can't wait two minutes ?
label1 Move  Move  Move !
label1 Dr  Leonard Hofstadter  you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement  Do you waive reading of the charges ?
label1 Very well  Count the first  on or about the 28th day of April  the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency  to wit  my back teeth were floating  Count the second  the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower  to wit  one  unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens 
label1 Um  it's fairly technical 
label1 Do so  do so 
label1 Oh  that's ridiculous  A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory 
label1 Irrelevant  Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair  He thinks because he's short nobody can see up there 
label1 This isn't over 
label1 What is that you're eating ? Tonight is pizza night 
label1 Yes  and when Franconi's went out of business  we switched to Graziano's 
label1 This is Greek food ? Leonard  you hate Greek food 
label1 Fine  I'm nothing if not adaptable 
label1 Thank you  If you think about it  Greek food isn't that far from italian food  They share a spice palette  And what a civilization is the Greeks  They gave us science  democracy  and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat 
label1 The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb  Congratulations  Pizza night will now be at your apartment  Order one 
label1 A girls night ? Oh  I don't know if I'm up for an evening talking about rainbows  unicorns and menstrual cramps 
label1 Shotgun 
label1 Really  Amy ? Tobacco and alcohol ? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time ?
label1 It's talc  But as that's a primary ingredient of baby powder  I understand your confusion 
label1 I don't know how to process that 
label1 Other than my mother  my sister and my mee-maw  no  But in the interest of full disclosure  I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion  Every year I get a Christmas card from her  signed with far too many X's and O's 
label1 Thank you  Not necessary  We know everything there is to know about kissing  It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles 
label1 I'm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice 
label1 No  thank you  but for the record  I'm an excellent dancer  Proficient in the rumba  waltz and cha-cha 
label1 I don't see why that's surprising  I excel at so many things  You've had my sourdough bread 
label1 No  you most certainly are not 
label1 I saved a nun's life  Why am I being punished ?
label1 What happened to you ?
label1 What's 16 times 14 ?
label1 And there's your answer 
label1 If you're referring to the beverage  you know I don't drink  If you're referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle  I have one 
label1 It's hard to say no to yoo-hoo  The name literally beckons 
label1 Thank you  Is someone smoking ?
label1 You own a smoking monkey ?
label1 What's he doing here ?
label1 Remarkable  Aren't you worried about secondhand smoke ?
label1 is he deliberately blowing smoke at me ?
label1 Thank you  May I share something with you that's troubling me ?
label1 Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard  making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me 
label1 No  of course not 
label1 I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild  but I really need to talk to smart Amy now 
label1 Well  when challenged  monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing  assault and a stylized penile display  That's a little outside my comfort zone 
label1 Are you suggesting I play dirty ?
label1 Fascinating 
label1 Oh  good  you're up  I've written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly  I'd like you to sign it 
label1 Excellent question  Do you remember what happened to the alien  played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin  in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield ?
label1 That was my first thought  but all my cool stuff is here 
label1 Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds  this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you're in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter 
label1 20 seconds 
label1 I never bluff  Ten 
label1 It's a laptop with a full charge  Honestly  what do you see in him ?
label1 You may have gone to Cambridge  but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy 
label1 Good morning  Amy 
label1 Ah  memory impairment  the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle 
label1 All right  Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home  you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes  following which you passed out on your bathroom floor  I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow  set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy  and I left 
label1 I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked 
label1 You're preaching to the choir  sister 
label1 Good news  I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess 
label1 Uh  do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem ? Five words  transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation 
label1 It's what I do  But wait  there's more  I also invented two new chess pieces  The serpent  and the old woman 
label1 Unless  it gets to the old woman in time  in which case she sucks out the poison  turning her into the Grand Empress  a piece combining the power of the knight  queen and serpent 
label1 That's because it's simple 
label1 And a third person  It's three-person chess  I must say  ever since you started having regular intercourse  your mind has lost its keen edge  You should reflect on that 
label1 Yes  and he never unified gravity with the other forces  If he hadn't been such a hound dog  we'd all have time machines 
label1 You know I'm right 
label1 Knight to old woman six-and-a-third  Brilliant move  Thank you 
label1 Sorry  I have company 
label1 I don't want to hug you 
label1 Blue  as in depressed 
label1 I don't know what colour lonely is 
label1 Red is angry  yellow is frightened  green is jealous and blue is depressed  Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely 
label1 All right  Come in  You look positively orange with loneliness  No  I don't see that catching on at all 
label1 I'm working on my three-person chess game 
label1 It's three-person chess  Did you bring a friend ?
label1 Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess  Can you believe this guy ? Social protocol does  however  require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need 
label1 It's not optional  We're out of tea  I hope you like bouillon 
label1 Actually  I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece  How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey  the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin ?
label1 The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves  there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself 
label1 Yellow  Go ahead 
label1 It was its own point  Go on 
label1 All right 
label1 I'd like to buy a scone 
label1 When it's done charging  Or you land on the time machine  Obviously 
label1 Well  that's it then  I'm dead 
label1 I'm sorry  do I really need to connect the dots for you ? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home  sweet home  Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend 
label1 Yes  I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin  some  uh  syrup of ipecac  to induce vomiting  and a mint 
label1 He drank from Leonard's glass  Words they'll be carving into my tombstone 
label1 Oh  this is a nightmare !
label1 To the bar  to sterilize my mouth with alcohol  Gang way ! Dead man walking !
label1 I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit 
label1 Fine  Thank you for asking  I love you so much 
label1 Fire demon 
label1 Could you please play the game without commenting on every card ?
label1 Oh  dear Lord !
label1 Oh  other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system  hunky-dory 
label1 So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all ?
label1 Jibber-jabber ? I don't jibber-jabber 
label1 Oh  I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory  specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space 
label1 Interesting  do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from ?
label1 To a hospital ? Full of sick people ? Oh  I don't think so 
label1 I can't 
label1 Not all germs  Just the ones that will kill me  It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives  just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax 
label1 I would think he would know that 
label1 Fine  I'll go  Just for the record  my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital  She went in to visit my Uncle Roger  caught something and bit the dust a week later  The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's mantel 
label1 A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack 
label1 Regardless  coronary problems are eminently treatable  What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital 
label1 Disagree 
label1 Howard  I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home 
label1 Pneumococcus  streptococcus  staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses 
label1 This might be a good time to point out  Howard  that friendship requires a certain give and take  Hold the door !
label1 No  I haven't  It's all good 
label1 Mountain Elf 
label1 Must you ?
label1 Zandor  Wizard of the North  Ha ! I win 
label1 It wouldn'help  The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death 
label1 Bernadette  before you change the subject  does anyone have any final comments on Leonard's faulty digestive system ?
label1 Oh  congratulations 
label1 Unless he takes Bernadette's last name  And considering her advanced status  that could open some doors for him 
label1 I must say  Amy  I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD 
label1 Your doctorate is in neurobiology  I fail to see the distinction 
label1 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically  Yes  I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it 
label1 Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching 
label1 All right 
label1 Rotating 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  yes  yes  oh  yes ! Amy  I've never been touched like this before ! Oh ! Oh  my hands are magic !
label1 There's someone at my door 
label1 I can see how that would be upsetting  Come in  I'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch 
label1 No  I can't authorize that 
label1 The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye  not a bed for a bed 
label1 All right  This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard's bedroom  Sign here  indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression 
label1 Wait  Not yet  We still have to go over safety procedures  Now  the apartment has three emergency exits located here  here  and here  In the event of a power outage  luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit 
label1 I never kid about safety 
label1 Not important  Your sugar was a little high  I'd follow up with your regular physician  In the meantime  I have some paperwork here for you to go over 
label1 Boilerplate stuff  A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest  And a living will and durable power of attorney 
label1 As your friend  let's hope it doesn't come to that  Please sign 
label1 Also  you're tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners  Tonight is Thai food  You'll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server  If you have any questions  here's the FAQ sheet  or if you prefer the human touch  I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights 
label1 What is this ?
label1 Remarkable  I'm just realizing how much Leonard's been skating by all these years 
label1 Yes  it's ' Penny  get your own Wi-Fi  No spaces 
label1 My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me 
label1 The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus  He was replaced by a superior species 
label1 You're living here provisionally  But I must say it's looking good 
label1 Here's an interesting fact about alcohol 
label1 Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated  Can you guess what the other is ? Hint  sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks 
label1 When does a monkey have a trunk ?
label1 What are you doing here ?
label1 I said  what are you doing here ?
label1 I have paperwork that says differently 
label1 Irrelevant  Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you're not going to ruin it 
label1 Leonard  do you understand this ?
label1 Talk to him 
label1 What does it look like ?
label1 It's not what it looks like  It's not what it looks like 
label1 Penny's brain teaser this morning  She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom  She is dishevelled  and Raj is dressed only in a sheet  The sole clue  it's not what it looks like 
label1 If I could  I would  but I can't  so I shan't  Now  knowing Penny  the obvious answer is  they engaged in coitus  But  since that's what it looked like  we can rule that out  Let's put on our thinking cap  shall we ?
label1 No  you weren't listening  She said  it's not what it looks like 
label1 Oh  Well don't I look silly sitting here wearing this ?
label1 Hey  Leonard  is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head ?
label1 That sounds like sarcasm  but I'm going to disregard it  because I have an agenda  Paintball  Specifically  the interdepartmental tournament this weekend  Now  in order to function better as a fighting unit  I thought we should establish a chain of command  Now  it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you  but the question remains  by how much ? Now  I don't see me as some four-star general  back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence  But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper  because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe  This might take some thought  As you were 
label1 Subtlety isn't her strong suit  is it ?
label1 Who said that ? Leonard  I can hear your voice  but I can't see you 
label1 Oh  there you are  Leonard  I know you're upset about recent events  and I have someone here to help 
label1 No  it's not Amy 
label1 Oh  Leonard  is it really necessary to caption the obvious ?
label1 All right  this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle 
label1 Give it a second to load  Whenever you're ready  AT & T ! Okay  here we go  This is us here  To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department  According to their Twitter feed  they're out of sunblock  which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma  That's our edge  All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge  the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won't know what hit them  All right  let's move out 
label1 You can't quit  That's a court-martial offence  That's punishable by You can't quit 
label1 This is a game to you ? Uh  was the Battle of Antietam a game ? Huh ? Was the sack of Rome a game ?
label1 No  Jamba Juice is for heroes  And that's what we're going to be 
label1 Excuse me  It's Major Sheldon Cooper  With my last breath  I awarded myself a battlefield promotion  It's kind of a big deal 
label1 What about Nebraska ?
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 It's eight o'clock in the morning in Mumbai  How can she have dinner ?
label1 All right  so technically it's not a dinner date  I suppose you could call it a  uh  dinfast date  But if you did  you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking  such as  Hey  Leonard  how was your dinfast with Priya last night ?
label1 You didn't let me finish  Dinfast
label1 Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens  Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast  Dinfast
label1 Oh  yes  Priya  Leonard  you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs 
label1 Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career  Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive  you could use that time to take up a hobby 
label1 Yes  I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine  I bet you could give him a run for his money 
label1 When I rise to power  those people will be sterilized 
label1 Don't you like Amy ?
label1 Well  there's the difference 
label1 If we were an old married couple  the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles 
label1 A good wife would go to the store 
label1 Good  On the way to see the lawyer  pick up some tea and cookies  I must say  I am enjoying your new chair 
label1 It is  Aligns the lumbar  cradles the coccyx  balances the buttocks  This is a chair worthy of the name 
label1 I've been sitting in garbage !
label1 There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor 
label1 Name one time I've ever done that 
label1 I said  name one  You really need to work on your listening skills 
label1 You need to remove that chair from the building  It's a health hazard 
label1 Really ?
label1 All right  It is a comfortable chair 
label1 No  thank you 
label1 For your safety  please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death 
label1 Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team  these premises are condemned 
label1 Is not  Is not  is not 
label1 You're good friends with Penny  right ?
label1 I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture 
label1 Cholera is water-borne  You're mocking me 
label1 Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building 
label1 All right  name your price 
label1 You mean like Salt Lake City ?
label1 Thank you 
label1 No  I dislike the sound of the harp  Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I'm going to experience an episode from my past 
label1 Penny  a moment  We just had Thai food  In that culture  the last morsel is called the krengjai piece  and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group 
label1 I've seen pictures of your mother  keep eating 
label1 Wait  Uh  which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia  the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory ?
label1 No  Penny  don't give up  you can get this 
label1 Oh  I'm not buying anything  They're having a lecture  H-O gauge railroading  Half the size of O-gauge  but twice the fun  Very controversial topic 
label1 I'll let you know after tonight  Unlike some people  I'm going in with an open mind  Who am I kidding ? Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge 
label1 Howard  I think I can help here  Yes  Bernadette  that's exactly what he thinks 
label1 You don't know the half of it  It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes  But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets 
label1 Not my fault  You said there'd be other scientists there my age 
label1 Ha-ha  you have to go to a wedding 
label1 All this years  I've been so wrong  The tinier the train  the more concentrated the fun 
label1 Better than James Bond  because he's tinier 
label1 All aboard ! Woo-woo ! It's official  I'm an H-O trainiac 
label1 Leonard  Check it out  I bought an N-gauge locomotive  Half the size of H-O  Look  it fits in my mouth 
label1 To send a message  She is not for you 
label1 Not for you !
label1 The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door  You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous  foul-smelling  moss-covered ogre  What do you do ?
label1 Seventeen  The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass  By the by  I liked it  too 
label1 You see a dragon 
label1 Gentlemen  please focus  You're facing a fire-breathing dragon 
label1 Because you don't have a girlfriend ? Well  good Lord  if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons  this game's in serious trouble 
label1 One moment  I'm conducting an experiment 
label1 A side of corn succotash  Hmm  Interesting 
label1 Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with  A pitcher of margaritas 
label1 Hamburgers and lemonade 
label1 And now for dessert  come on  hot fudge sundae  come on  hot fudge sundae  Bam ! That's what I'm talking about !
label1 Don't thank me  Thank the dice  They told me what percentage of my face to shave 
label1 Because it's working  In the past few weeks  unburdened by trivial decisions  I've co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals  and I'm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle 
label1 The dice giveth and the dice taketh away 
label1 Yeah  I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion 
label1 Let's see 
label1 Okay  get this  It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts  because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy 
label1 No  you're wrong  See  as you know  a few years ago  I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public  Well  from time to time  I notarize banking documents for Raj  The Koothrappalis aren't just rich  they're Richie Rich rich 
label1 About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck 
label1 Can't figure out what to do ? I remember those days  Now  if you'll excuse me  I have to
label1 Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home ? Come on  papa needs to void his bladder  Oh  that's not what you want to see after three buttermilks 
label1 Hurry  hurry  hurry 
label1 I don't know  If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection  and I've long thought we should  is this really the sword to start with ?
label1 Well  off the top of my head  I'd have to go with Excalibur  It gives you the right to rule England 
label1 Fair enough  It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England 
label1 Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger ; wouldn't we look silly ? Okay  let's go for it 
label1 Okay ? It's magnificent 
label1 Oh  did you hear that ? We're getting the friends and family discount  We are honoured and we will take it 
label1 What are you doing ? Two fifty is already the discounted price 
label1 Take it  take it 
label1 Killing you ? I can't breathe 
label1 Oh  now  we can't let him lose money  Leonard  I'm so sorry 
label1 I've long said  what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts 
label1 Hello  Wil Wheaton 
label1 It's part of my sword collection  Do you have a sword collection ?
label1 I'm not surprised 
label1 Sucker  Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount 
label1 I see what you're doing  You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy  he tells everyone we're going to be there  and when we don't show  he looks the fool  Fiendishly clever 
label1 And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out  leaving him humiliated in front of his guests  Love it 
label1 Possibly 
label1 It's not that simple  Leonard 
label1 Of course  Now get it yourself  you traitor 
label1 In case you have forgotten  Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment '
label1 Mohammed Lee 
label1 Mohammed is the most common first name in the world  Lee  the most common surname  As I didn't know the answer  I thought that gave me a mathematical edge 
label1 That was a lovely toast  Kudos 
label1 Simultaneously  a festival of cloying clich
label1 Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us  And yes  it sure is  buddy 
label1 Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle  in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you  but not both ?
label1 In fact  I have 61 of them  Would you like to see the list ?
label1 You just got off the list  Would you like back on it ? This'll just take a moment  It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy 
label1 As a child  I loved Wesley Crusher  Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek  So  I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear  so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed  But he never showed  because apparently  it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares  Oh  damn ! The floppy failed  Well  whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989  congratulations  you just made the list 
label1 Interesting  You see betrayal in others  but not yourself 
label1 Oh  of course you would have to believe that  Evil always thinks it's doing right  Excuse me  Stormtrooper  These are the droids you're looking for 
label1 Not yet 
label1 No  Leonard  this is your last chance  One day  a historian is going to come to you and say  is it true you were friends with Dr  Sheldon Cooper ? And you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble  I was  but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers 
label1 Oh  good  You picked me  you picked me 
label1 Brent Spiner ?
label1 I don't care 
label1 I did  but I think I've kind of outgrown Star Trek  You know  stock characters  ludicrous plots  beam me up  What a load of hooey 
label1 Yeah  even that  You look like a dork 
label1 What I'd like is for him to have a more depressing home  This is quite lovely 
label1 An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure 
label1 To Sheldon  sorry this took so long  Your friend  Wil Wheaton 
label1 Look  everyone  Wil Wheaton is my friend !
label1 Brent Spiner  what have you done ? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend  Wil Wheaton 
label1 You've already signed something  Brent Spiner  Your name on my list  From this moment on  you are my mortal enemy 
label1 Come on  buddy  Let's not waste another second on this loser  Love your house 
label1 Well  Mom  if I did  it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles 
label1 Frankly  Mom  I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become  willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge 
label1 The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away  Well  Mom  according to my itinerary for our weekend together  the fun begins with fried chicken 
label1 Good  ' cause I got you everything you need to make it  You are in for a treat  My mother's fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin 
label1 Of course she does  Making me food is her way of saying I love you  Making me food when she's too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you 
label1 Won't that spoil our appetites for the chicken you're going to make me ?
label1 Told you 
label1 Stop yelling ! I'm not happy about this 
label1 The prospect of fried chicken 
label1 And that reminds me of another saying  You can lead a chicken to Crisco  but you can'tmake your mother fry it 
label1 Get them before they get us 
label1 Mom  you remember Rajesh ? Rajesh  my mother 
label1 Oh  yes  born alone  die alone  It's a tragic human condition  Now  Raj  if you'll excuse my mother  she's about to make a pecan pie that'll be so good I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken 
label1 Coffee 
label1 I'm not going to get my pecan pie  am I ?
label1 Nice  Kick a man when he's down 
label1 I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together  just the two of us 
label1 Careful  you're using too much Downey  You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy 
label1 It is nice  isn't it ?
label1 It was in my weekly e-mail blast  Right between beet season is finally here  and uh-oh  red stool from beets leads to cancer scare 
label1 Yes  Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures 
label1 Now that will not be in this week's e-mail blast 
label1 I've got a treat for us tomorrow  Mom  I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology  And the best part is  at the Q and A afterward  I've worked up a couple of Q's that will stump his sorry A 
label1 What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate ?
label1 What do I say ? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit with your sushi  and your sadness and your slutty shirts  Stop it 
label1 Mom  I want to apologize for my behaviour last night 
label1 Great  Now  you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture  Look  he will be stating that the universe is older than 6000 years  but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts 
label1 But I apologized  And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong 
label1 I'm not going  and you can't make me 
label1 Well  I'm going to stand here until you change your mind 
label1 I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me 
label1 We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship  Mother 
label1 That lecture was a waste of time  I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper 
label1 No  I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason 
label1 No  Or to use the clinical term  nuh-uh 
label1 Oh  there it is  It always comes back to monkeys with you  Just monkeys  monkeys  monkeys 
label1 Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person ?
label1 Oh  yes  the common cold  Just like everyone else  You'd love that  wouldn't you ?
label1 Look at the two of us  Me  a highly regarded physicist  The kind of mind that comes along once  maybe twice in a generation  You  the common man  tired from your labours as a stockbroker  or vacuum cleaner salesman  or bootblack  But deep down inside  apparently we're just two peas in a pod  A regular pea  and the kind of pea that comes along once  maybe twice in a generation  Rain  Another great equalizer  Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike 
label1 Thank you  Yeah  I've learned something today  You and I  in so many ways  other than intelligence and what counts  we're the same 
label1 I hope so  because if this is well  life isn't worth living 
label1 And just to be clear  only her baby and not these other people 
label1 Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off ?
label1 Thanks  MomYou ' re the best 
label1 I know  it filled in last year  I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit 
label1 No  we don't  The one we have works great 
label1 Or maybe I'm part of a new species  that lives for hundreds of years  which means I'm still basically a toddler 
label1 Does this mean you're not going to sing Soft Kitty ?
label1 Get out !
label1 Well  I know  but he means well  Sing 
label1 And reverse the spin on the antiproton  and gamma becomes alpha  multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero  and there we have it  Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o'clock 
label1 Yes  there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled 
label1 Please  fright depends on an element of surprise  The simple fact is  because I am much smarter than you  and able to anticipate your actions  it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me 
label1 Gentlemen 
label1 Yes  enjoy your japes  gentlemen  You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic  Well  you've forgotten one thing  I am also a son of the Lone Star state  I'm Texas through and through  And we know how to settle scores down there  If you doubt me  ask Mexico 
label1 Be sure to check the mail 
label1 Nothing  It's not suspicious that I'm fixating  It's consistent with my personality 
label1 Leonard doesn't have time to chat  he has to get the mail 
label1 It is  isn't it ? Oh  bother  Isn't that just always the way ? You go to staple something  and you're out of staples  Gosh  I wish I'd known that earlier today when I was at Staples 
label1 well  no  no  I need something more permanent to join these papers  Say  don't you keep staples in your top desk drawer ?
label1 Be a lamb and check 
label1 It's a snake  A terrifying snake 
label1 Stop talking like that  You've been rendered speechless by fear 
label1 I tried to scare an Indian with a snake  Come on  Cooper  You're better than this 
label1 Hello  Howard  I've realized that you scaring me was all in jest  Allow me to say  job well done 
label1 Science  You wouldn't understand 
label1 I thought you were leaving the apartment 
label1 Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies ?
label1 All right  So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity  Probably won't be relying on Seuss here  Although One Fish  Two Fish  Red Fish  Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable  Go on 
label1 You know  the German philosopher  Friedrich Nietzsche  believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men 
label1 It's worth noting that he died of syphilis 
label1 On your way home  will you pick up some orange juice ?
label1 It's me  Sheldon  Mrs  Wolowitz 
label1 Really ? That's very unsettling 
label1 It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials  So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand  Put ' er there  you old so-and-so 
label1 Holy smoke  why didn't I think of that ? You're a better man than I  Howard Wolowitz  You put ' er there  you son of a gun !
label1 It was a harmless Halloween prank  Look 
label1 Well  I thought he made that up  Isn't hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people ?
label1 Oh  no ! I can't !
label1 Ladies  please  These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach  But through no one's fault  Penny  the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined  And again  I'm looking at no one in particular  Penny 
label1 I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists 
label1 Topic one  Faster-than-light particles at CERN  paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese ? And converse 
label1 You're leaving ?
label1 Ah  New topic  Women  delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy ?
label1 Can we ? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation 
label1 I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke  come on  people  it's just a giant thistle  to zzz  the onamona-poetry of sleep 
label1 Sorry  I'm a little distracted  I can't seem to get in touch with Amy  I tried e-mail  video chat  tweeting her  posting on her Facebook wall  texting her  nothing 
label1 The telephone  You know  Leonard  in your own simple way  you may be the wisest of us all  Voice mail  Curiouser and curiouser 
label1 Okay  You know  I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood 
label1 Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat ?
label1 Leonard  I was just mentioning an interesting local news item  Now  thanks to you  I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat 
label1 How can I ? You won't stop talking about it 
label1 Where are you going ?
label1 You didn't respond to any of my electronic communications 
label1 Would you like to talk about it ? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer 
label1 Point of order  As you're in distress  it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage  But I'm a guest in your home  so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage  How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages ?
label1 If you'd like to take your mind off what's troubling you  uh  word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted 
label1 And that made you feel sad ?
label1 I knew it  Just keep going  I guess I'm good at this 
label1 When they were over here  did you fail to offer them a beverage ? ' Cause I can see how that could stick in someone's craw 
label1 Always 
label1 Oh  boy  You know ours is a relationship of the mind 
label1 Counterproposal  I will gently stroke your head and repeat  aw  who's a good Amy 
label1 Neck massage  then you get me that beverage 
label1 Very well  Oh  boy 
label1 Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler  This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star  And why ? Your gal pals  Penny and Bernadette  went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy  an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me  the future of string theory or my Lego fun time 
label1 You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence  get your women in line ! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right  I am a man of science  not someone's snuggle bunny !
label1 You invited her to lunch four years ago  Everything about her is on you  you make it so !
label1 Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone  he proposed answering it with ahoy ? Ahoy  I like it  Amy ? Is that you ? Have you been drinking ? I'm sorry  I bet my sweet what ? Well  all right  We're on our way 
label1 Leonard  be glad you can't keep a woman  They are a handful 
label1 Yes  Cuddles  We cuddled  Grow up  Leonard 
label1 I'm begging both of you  please  let's go 
label1 Shoo  shoo ! Be gone !
label1 There's a bird outside the window  and he won't go away  That is the hell that is going on  We have no worms or seeds here  Shoo  shoo 
label1 It's called ornithophobia  And someday it will be recognized as a true disability  and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building  Which is unfortunate  because I have a fear of nets 
label1 That doesn't help 
label1 Good idea  Attention is what birds want 
label1 Please  that's a seagull  If you're not going to help  don't help 
label1 It depends on the activity  For a prostate exam  yes  If you're playing Vegas  I'd add sequins 
label1 Do you think it's a date ?
label1 Not at all 
label1 Really ? A blazer ? All right 
label1 For an audience with the queen  yes  For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can  you look great 
label1 A minute 
label1 This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator 
label1 Yeah  but you've got a can-do attitude and that's what's important 
label1 The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me ? My first memory  a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup 
label1 Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world 
label1 Age seven  a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree  Age twelve  a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth  Age sixteen  a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass  Need I go on ?
label1 It's not a death ray  It's just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off  Trust me  if I had a death ray  I wouldn't be living here  I'd be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray  All right  and in three  two  one 
label1 This is ridiculous  I'm a grown man from Texas  This isn't a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose  It's just a blue jay 
label1 You're biologists  Biology is the study of living things  That's a living thing  get cracking 
label1 Oh  come now  Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class 
label1 No  Bernadette  don't be a hero !
label1 Yes  It's very sweet  Now  slowly and carefully  flush him down the toilet 
label1 Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds  I'm not going to be another statistic 
label1 I did it ! I actually did it  Okay  now flush him 
label1 It's remarkable  All that time spent in fear  And for what ? He's magnificent  Oh  dear  I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage 
label1 My phone's on the desk over there  Take a picture of us together  Make it good enough to go on a mug  a mouse pad  and a calendar  If you were a dove  I'd call you Lovey-Dovey  Oh  Who am I kidding ? This isn't a moment for strict adherence to the literal  You're just my little Lovey-Dovey  aren't you ?
label1 Yes  It should have a big picture of him  and the words  is this your bird ? Not anymore  We're going to have so much fun together  You can carry messages to all my enemies  I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite 
label1 Nonsense  No  Lovey-Dovey doesn't sleep in a cage  No  Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest  which I'm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room  Isn't that right  LD ?
label1 How could he do this to me ? Get back here  you stupid bird  so I can love you !
label1 Well  A  comic books employ storytelling through sequential art  a medium that dates back 17000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux  and B  you play the harp  Like that's cool 
label1 I know what this is about  Given the professional standstill you're at  you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching  Yes  And if I may suggest  consider changing disciplines  Yeah  to the humanities  perhaps history  One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things  you know  you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back  You could have fun with that 
label1 Oh  of course he is  She's very interesting  Did you know  when she was 14  she severed the webbing between her own toes ?
label1 I'm not sure how to respond  Leonard  I don't own Amy  Can't own a person  At least not since ? 1863  President Lincoln freed the ? Slaves ! Come on Leonard  if you're going to teach history  these are the kind of facts you'll have to know 
label1 Fine  The record shall so reflect  Now  getting back to the problem at hand  what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist 
label1 Oh  Leonard  Lots of people love you and want to help you  but they can't until you admit the problem 
label1 Where's Stuart ?
label1 Who are you ?
label1 Oh  I guess I was wrong 
label1 Am I okay ? Leonard  I'm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me  all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction  and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule  Am I okay ?
label1 Flaming Spittoon  And for the record  I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes  We're playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches  and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion 
label1 And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous  too ?
label1 Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat ?
label1 All right  fine  Let's just play 
label1 And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy  not me  I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here 
label1 I'm in the matrix  Leonard  I see everything 
label1 Don't be silly  I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact 
label1 Really ? You think I care if a man  what  shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady ?
label1 You are free to believe whatever you like  And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali 
label1 And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter 
label1 And unfriend Howard Wolowitz 
label1 Thank you 
label1 I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me 
label1 No  Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart ? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight 
label1 I am not trying to get her back  But  out of curiosity  what is a way ?
label1 I'm the guy 
label1 Are you sure ? That would explain so much  Your constant presence in my apartment  that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me  the way you call me sweetie all the time 
label1 You tramp 
label1 Strap on a pair ? Of what  skates ?
label1 Excuse me  Excuse me  Pardon me  Pardon me  Excuse me  Hi  Stuart 
label1 Pardon me  Excuse me 
label1 Stuart  please  You're being rude 
label1 With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever  physical or otherwise  I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend 
label1 You're being impossible 
label1 Fine  Amy  will you be my girlfriend ?
label1 Well  that's enough of that  Sorry to interrupt  You two enjoy your date  Here's a dollar for your troubles  Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids 
label1 Wow  Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend ? Good thing I drew this up 
label1 I present to you the relationship agreement  A binding covenant that  in its 31 pages  enumerates  iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper  here and after known as the boyfriend  and Amy Farrah Fowler  here and after known as the girlfriend 
label1 Mutual indemnification always is  Why don't you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp 
label1 Feel free to retain a lawyer 
label1 I got a splinter 
label1 Relationship agreement Section 4  Boo-boos and Ouchies  You have to take care of it 
label1 I believe that you're capable of great change  Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day 
label1 In the year 2000  Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter 
label1 You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird 
label1 Oh  I thought it was a game 
label1 Okay  Penny  if it were a game  here are your choices  An e-mail from an old acquaintance  or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown  Pick 
label1 And that's how it's done 
label1 Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch ?
label1 Was he the one who wedgied you so hard  your testicle reascended  and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down ?
label1 Was he the one who used your head to open a nut ?
label1 Oh  oh  oh  Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair ?
label1 You know  the holidays are just around the corner  Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there 
label1 Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm 
label1 Look at these men  They've managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose  You should pay attention  Leonard  Someday this could be you up there 
label1 So  what's got you up ? Did you have a bad clam ?
label1 Wear loafers  Look at Dr  Saul Perlmutter up there  clutching that Nobel Prize  What's the matter  Saul ? You afraid someone's going to steal it ? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant ?
label1 Oh  now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand  Yeah  check for your watch  Gustaf  He might have lifted it 
label1 And there's the first zinger  Ouch 
label1 Congratulations ? The Newcomb medal ? Oh  please  That's the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework 
label1 Oh  good Lord  are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this ?
label1 Technically  Howard's the gear head  Leonard's just a dime store laser jockey 
label1 The smartest ? All right  you know  I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm  but even I know that was a doozy  Leonard  you can't live in fear of this man forever 
label1 You clearly don't  What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you're a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size  his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity 
label1 A little bit ? The man Super Glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples 
label1 This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard  One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens 
label1 You're being too kind  Leonard  You ruined him 
label1 I help the weak  It's yet another way I'm exactly like Batman 
label1 Oh  half and half instead of whole milk ?
label1 Heated to precisely 183 degrees ?
label1 Seven little marshmallows  no more no less ?
label1 One for good luck  Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton 
label1 Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks 
label1 You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa 
label1 As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who've tormented us for years  we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep we kill him  I said it would be nice  I didn't say we should do it 
label1 In case it comes up again  this right here is an imposition 
label1 You're soft  This world's going to chew you up and spit you out 
label1 I'm not going to say I told you so  but we could have killed him 
label1 Well said  Boy Wonder 
label1 Don't answer that  It's a trick question  I speak from experience 
label1 You did it  Leonard  you stood up to your bully 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader  only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret 
label1 This is how you're going to entertain your little cousin and his friends ? By lying to them ?
label1 A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition  This is an ordinary top hat  You've chosen that card freely  I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister 
label1 Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement  When I was five  Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose 
label1 It's still there  Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security 
label1 All right  without objection  the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to  Any new business ?
label1 Ooh ! Speaking of good news  somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers 
label1 Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  Ooh  101 ! Air's getting a bit thin up here 
label1 Well  that's odd  We both washed up when we came in  It's probably a euphemism for urination 
label1 Not much  Although  I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears  I don't know what it is  when they smart munching on eucalyptus  I just melt inside 
label1 Oh  I see why you're confused  No  her news sounded important  but what you're forgetting is  it was an achievement in the field of biology  That's all about yucky  squishy things 
label1 What if they simply don't excite me ?
label1 She'd see right through that  We go to the zoo all the time  She knows my koala face  And for future reference  it's this 
label1 Had a rough night  I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head 
label1 It's after nine o'clock  at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats 
label1 No  I think I'll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away 
label1 I'll say 
label1 I'm sorry  It's the alcohol talking  Go on 
label1 Nuts to that  What else you got ?
label1 Well  that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it 
label1 It's appreciated  And if you ever manage to find a woman again  I'll be glad to return the favour 
label1 I don't think there's anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears 
label1 Ooh  a pocket watch 
label1 No  but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch 
label1 Well  she's very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin  Maybe they have a dressier version of that ?
label1 Excuse me  I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out  You'd be lucky to land a fella like me 
label1 Remarkable  Diamonds  crystallized carbon  Every day  people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire  But just because you've got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly  you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars 
label1 Really  Talk to me about that pocket watch 
label1 Good  good  if you had said something clever  she might've gotten suspicious 
label1 I told you 
label1 You're right  the tiara was too much 
label1 As you know  lizards  cold-blooded animals  lack the ability to sense temperature  But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold  So  lizard weathermen would say things like  bring a sweater  it's slow outside  I love my mind 
label1 Oh  I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards  We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them  they'll just grow back  Oh ! My life-size cardboard Mr  Spock is here ! I know he wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion  but  oh goodie  oh goodie  oh goodie  Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded 
label1 Oh  no ! They sent the wrong Spock ! Live long and suck it  Zachary Quinto 
label1 Mm  I want to build a road  but I need wood  Do either of you fellows have wood ?
label1 You want to know my opinion ?
label1 Sarcasm ?
label1 All right  then  The reason you're fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment  your brilliant yet intimidating mother 
label1 It's called non-fiction for a reason  Leonard 
label1 Now  where were we ? Oh  yes  Does anyone have any wood ? Oh  come on ! I just want wood  Why are you making it so hard ?
label1 And now that I have some wood  I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement 
label1 We don't know that  Not to a certainty  All we know is that Leonard is home 
label1 Oh  of course  It's right here in my hand 
label1 Leonard ?
label1 Uh  can't complain  Thanks for asking  Well  what were you doing out at three o'clock in the morning ?
label1 I was using the bathroom 
label1 Really ? I didn't see you in there 
label1 Where ?
label1 In your pyjamas ?
label1 Without shoes ?
label1 On a cold winter's night ?
label1 Seems unlikely  Did you bring your asthma inhaler ?
label1 Well  then  I guess it's plausible  Hang on a second  mister 
label1 It's customary  when using the rest room at a retail establishment  to make a small purchase  Did you ?
label1 It's not about you  It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron 
label1 Needy Baby  Greedy Baby indeed 
label1 Leonard will be here in a moment  He's looking for a different parking space 
label1 You have a keen insight into the human heart  Amy Farrah Fowler 
label1 Well  I doubt they'd want to talk about that  so we're fine 
label1 People  people  please  before you say something you both regret  I'd like to place my order 
label1 I've got to go with Leonard on this  He is wrong more than anyone I know 
label1 Leonard  promise me that when our new waitress comes over  you will not start a complicated on-again  off-again relationship with her  because I am very  very hungry 
label1 This is a disaster  I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr  Spock cardboard standee  Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed ?
label1 You're right  I'll give him a shot 
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags  Over the next 52 weeks  you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology 
label1 Vexillology is the study of flags 
label1 Did you have fun doing it ?
label1 Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast  not unlike the only two-sided state flag  Oregon  Oh  look  Hello  Mr  Beaver  In future episodes  we'll answer some burning questions  What's the only non-rectangular flag ? What animal appears most often on flags ? What animal appears second most often on flags ? And more 
label1 Now  today's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun  but it is important  Flags : you gotta know how to hold ' em  you gotta know how to fold ' em  Let's start by identifying the parts of our flag  This edge is the hoist  and it's used to '
label1 Cut  Did you not see we are rolling ?
label1 And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here !
label1 No  I'm a little rattled  But like the flag over Fort Sumter  I'm still here  And  take two  Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags  Over the next 52 weeks  you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology 
label1 Vexillology is why is there a face on that flag ?
label1 Confound it ! You're right  it's brilliant  Let's take it from the top 
label1 Cut ! Take 47 
label1 The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence  a fact that wasn't discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics  And thankfully  their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism 
label1 Speaking of cowboys  do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag ? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra  Oh  the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself 
label1 Careful  it's that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year's Who Con 
label1 All right  that's it  Who Con  you're out 
label1 How about constantly talks with food in her mouth ?
label1 Well done  Dr  Koothrappali 
label1 Oh  no  of course  I understand  You're afraid the world isn't ready for your taboo love  Your secret's safe with me 
label1 Kripke 
label1 Guten Tag  das YouTube  Ich bin ein Bavarian 
label1 Emergency preparedness drill 
label1 Yeah  you know how it works  Once a quarter  keep our readiness up  Now  rise and shine  sleepy head  Half the town is probably dead 
label1 You make that joke every three months  I still don't get it  Leonard  wait  What are you doing ?
label1 Look around you  there's hypothetical broken glass everywhere  Really ? You're going to face Armageddon without your orthotics ? All right  your choice 
label1 And that's why we wear hard hats 
label1 I'll tell you exactly how he did  Readiness : unsatisfactory  Follows direction : barely  Attitude : a little too much  Overall : not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno  his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else's day 
label1 You can't go home  You have to take me to the dentist at four o'clock 
label1 Of course I can  It's coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia  that's the problem  Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning  I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico 
label1 Yeah  they have to  I'm a biter 
label1 Wrong  sir  Wrong  Under section 37B of the roommate agreement  miscellaneous duties  you are obligated to take me to the dentist  See ? It's right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products  '
label1 Well  it has  Ask anybody 
label1 Think carefully here  Clause 209 suspends our friendship  and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials  Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent  utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall 
label1 Right here  Use your finger 
label1 All right  That's it  We are now no longer companions  boon or otherwise  We are now merely acquaintances  To amend the words of Toy Story  you have not got a friend in me 
label1 Yeah  well  tell it to someone who cares 
label1 ' Sup ? My apologies  I would've been here sooner  but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it 
label1 Oh  your concern for me is touching  It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow 
label1 You're my girlfriend and you're not going to cater to my every need ? Oh  where'd the magic go ?
label1 Well  if Amy's too busy  that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier  thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs  tentatively entitled You're Welcome  Mankind  All right  then  just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake  Uh  dentist  Okay  we can circle back to that one  Um  well  who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes ? Anyone ? Oh  That one had hoot written all over it  Um  all right  uh  dermatologist ? Allergist ? Podiatrist ? Supercuts ? Okay  okay  here's a fun one  Um  I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs  Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA ?
label1 What's that ?
label1 Hello  Stuart 
label1 You moved up one  My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates  So  uh  how are you ?
label1 And your father ? Alive ?
label1 How about your grandparents  they alive ?
label1 Oh  I'm so sorry for your loss  On a cheerier note  I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon  What do you say you take me over there  buddy boy ?
label1 Can't help a friend out in a time of need  huh ? I see where your therapist was coming from 
label1 ' Sup ?
label1 Not necessary  No  I found a service that'll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning  Mostly they cater to dogs  but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind 
label1 Are you suggesting that you've come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement ?
label1 Power failure  Implementing power-failure protocol 
label1 Oh  that was wildly carcinogenic  Anyway  it's too bad you're no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship  because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency  Please try not to see anything by this light  It's not for you 
label1 And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now  I like to think they ate him first 
label1 But candles ? During a blackout ? Are you mad ? That's a fire hazard  No  Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick 
label1 Excuse me  Leonard 
label1 Social niceties have been suspended  Leonard  We're in a state of a emergency  The world has descended into darkened turmoil  Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day 
label1 I'm making s'mores  I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire 
label1 Yes  or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement 
label1 Really ? Huh ! Okay  In that case  I will have a s'more by myself  And then I'm gonna have s'more  By myself 
label1 What are you proposing ?
label1 Every time ?
label1 Of course you do  It's about you  like everything else 
label1 Of course you get a card  It's Leonard's Day 
label1 Oh  I don't know  But whoever that mystery man was  you should be eternally grateful  for without him  there would be no Leonard's Day 
label1 Oh  no pressure  Just get him a crummy card  you're good 
label1 Gentlemen  I think I've come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science  Physics Mad-Libs  Now  give me a number 
label1 Uh-huh  And an irrational constant 
label1 I said funny 
label1 Ha  Perfect  Okay  Get this  Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon  Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a
label1 Stop ! I'm going to wet myself !
label1 You don't like written suggestions  You don't like when I give them to you while we're urinating in the men's room  If I didn't know any better  I'd say that you're one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions 
label1 Bleeding from my ears 
label1 Yes  That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse 
label1 Will they  Leonard ?
label1 I have GPS on my phone  I know you turned around 
label1 My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child  A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach  I got the message 
label1 It's like I'm living in a dictatorship  You must take a vacation  you must have fun  you must enjoy life 
label1 One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation  but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new  He went to work in his friend's biology lab  Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist  part of the Manhattan Project 
label1 Now you do  too  Oh ! I have a brilliant idea  Amy's a biologist  I'll go work in her lab 
label1 Okay  what do we start with ? Maybe splicing some genes  clone a sheep  perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse's back ? Ha-ha  I'm a freak !
label1 Wash those bea Oh  I get it  a little hazing for the new fella  Yeah  I'd better keep and eye out for  what  shoe polish on the microscope  or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich ?
label1 What ? Excuse me  you have Dr  Sheldon Cooper in your lab  You're gonna make him do the dishes ? That's like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar 
label1 I have plenty of experience in biology  I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998  And it's still alive  Let's do this 
label1 Here you go  This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan 
label1 Y-you're being ridiculous  Those are perfectly clean 
label1 Biologists are mean 
label1 There was something wrong with that detergent  That was way too bubbly 
label1 I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter 
label1 You know what this place needs ? A suggestion box 
label1 This is preposterous  I think you're giving me these tasks because you're afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do  I'll show you up 
label1 Yes  that's what I think  And I'm super smart  so it's probably true 
label1 Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged  It's the same reason Einstein failed math 
label1 It's not  I'll have you know  in the field of physics  we work with particles so small  they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus  i  e   when your locus coeruleus sits around the house  it sits around the house 
label1 No  What you see is a man trembling with confidence  Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much ?
label1 I'm on vacation  Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole  Social convention is stupid 
label1 You know  I have ten fingers and ten toes  If I tell you a story about each one of them  we'll be here all day  let's just move on 
label1 Ah  seeing as I'm on vacation  a pina colada seems appropriate  Extra pineapple slices  extra whipped cream  extra cherries  extra umbrellas  and  uh  hold the rum  Don't let me have too many of those 
label1 Oh  better than good 
label1 Excuse me  this is a fairly substantial wound 
label1 I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory  After all  I did book the whole week 
label1 I was not myself  I had lost a lot of thumb blood 
label1 That is your opinion 
label1 I'm sorry that you weren't able to '
label1 That my genius '
label1 That the soap was '
label1 Fine  Sorry 
label1 Next year I'm going to Epcot 
label1 These shrimp are all the same size  There's no the logical order to eat them in 
label1 Mm  indeed 
label1 What are you doing here  Kripke ?
label1 This is not your office  It hasn't been assigned yet 
label1 Shut it  Offices are assigned by seniority  I arrived at the university first 
label1 I found him  He's in the bathroom  President Siebert ?
label1 I'm sorry  We just need a word 
label1 We tried  His assistant said he was on sabbatical  Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut 
label1 Oh  my  President Siebert  I don't mean to be an alarmist  but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia  If you're interested  I can send you a link to a YouTube video that'll show you how to perform your own rectal exam  Yeah  uh  helpful hint  trim your nails first 
label1 Oh  he's just trying to butter you up  And for the record  butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam 
label1 Kripke ?
label1 You're in my spot 
label1 We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen  And if that doesn't work  I'm going to poison his tea 
label1 Fine  In the interest of preserving our friendship '
label1 Well  that's a little hard to hear  but all right  As you know  the essence of diplomacy is compromise  With that in mind  I propose the following  I will take Rothman's office  and you will find a way to be okay with that 
label1 You sure I can't get you that cup of tea ?
label1 Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors  All hail Sam Kass 
label1 Oh  it's very simple  Scissors cuts paper  paper covers rock  rock crushes lizard  lizard poisons Spock  Spock smashes scissors  scissors decapitates lizard  lizard eats paper  paper disproves Spock  Spock vaporizes rock  and as it always has  rock crushes scissors 
label1 Well  of course  Scissors cuts paper  paper covers rock  rock crushes lizard  lizard poisons Spock  Spock smashes scissors  scissors decapitates lizard  lizard eats paper  paper disproves Spock  Spock vaporizes rock  and as it always has  rock crushes scissors 
label1 Surely  Scissors cuts paper  paper covers rock  rock '
label1 Is he ? Well  then  it seems we have reached an impasse  I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel  I'd smack you with a glove  but just last week I packed away my winter things 
label1 Not pistols  Minds  A trivia contest  and you may choose the field of battle  Star Trek trivia  Star Trek : Next Generation trivia  Star Trek : Deep Space Nine trivia  Star Trek : Voyager trivia  or model trains 
label1 Five what ?
label1 Hey ! He did that on purpose 
label1 Use the force  Sheldon  Use the force 
label1 What do you propose ?
label1 I don't think so  Kripke  I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day 
label1 Who's unsatisfactory in P  E  now ?
label1 Ah  the spoils  I see why victors love them 
label1 Oh  of course you are  Feel free to drop by any time 
label1 Professor Rothman  This isn't your office any more  You're retired 
label1 I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt 
label1 Aha ! Good question  It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn't in my new office  No  It's next door  in Professor Davenport's office  who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause 
label1 Is it ? Listen 
label1 No  I hate them  but it gets worse  There it is 
label1 Yeah  It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes 
label1 You don't get it  do you ? That's a mockingbird  Mockingbirds can change their song  which means he's out of tune on purpose  He's mocking me  Oh dear  There it is again  Do you feel it ?
label1 No  The vibration  We are directly underneath the geology lab  and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again  Hey  gravel monkeys  if you need to shake rocks  try jiggling your heads around !
label1 How can I relax ? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman 
label1 What  and let him win ? Do I look crazy to you ? We're trying to think down here  you geode-loving feldspar jockeys !
label1 Help ! Somebody help !
label1 I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck 
label1 Okay  I like it a little better when you stay  but all right 
label1 Hello  I'm here for my haircut with Mr  D'Onofrio 
label1 He's not a barber  he's the nephew  He's an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry  Besides  Mr  D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas 
label1 When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber  so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr  D'Onofrio 
label1 Yes  there are 
label1 No  but my mother assured me they were sent here  and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn't have them  Uh  excuse me  Do you have access to my haircut records ?
label1 Fine  but if I come out of this looking like a dork  it's on you 
label1 Can you pass the Parmesan cheese ?
label1 I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes 
label1 Thank you for captioning my nightmare 
label1 I can't help it  I feel like a teen heartthrob 
label1 Penny  I know you mean well  offering the skills of the hill folk  but  um  here in town we don't churn our own butter  we don't  uh  make dresses out of gunny sacks  and  uh  we sure as shootin don't get our hair cut by bottle-blonde '
label1 I'm sorry  it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair 
label1 I'm sorry  I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time  My hair is growing at the rate of 46 yoctometers per femtosecond  I mean  if you're quiet  you can hear it 
label1 I tried once  They do men's and women's hair in the same room at the same time  It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse 
label1 Why don't I let my hair grow out ? Um  why don't I start wearing Birkenstocks and  uh  uh  seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it ?
label1 Mr  D'Onofrio ? It's Sheldon  They didn't have anything barber-themed in the gift shop  so I got you this  I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt  It says  um  get well bear-y soon  Trust me  if you were even a little conscious right now  you'd be laughing  Anyway  there's new studies that show  people in comas are aware of everything going on around them  With that in mind  if you can hear me  move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors 
label1 Yes  Do you have something I could use as a cape ?
label1 Oh  no  no  I'm just here to get my hair cut 
label1 I got to run  But not with scissors  that would be unsafe 
label1 No  I'm not all right  It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened 
label1 Leonard  explain it to her 
label1 I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day  But all my efforts  our dinner schedule  my pyjama rotation  my bowel movement spreadsheet  it's clear now  I've been wasting my time 
label1 Oh  please  everyone knows what's going to happen  But I see your point 
label1 You're right  I should embrace the chaos 
label1 I don't know  I could do anything  All bets are off  The world is my oyster  I got it  I'm going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight 
label1 Three in the morning is a good time for bongos 
label1 Leonard sleeps while I play bongos 
label1 Leonard no sleep while I play bongos  Bongo solo 
label1 Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun  Penny forgot to use the subjunctive 
label1 Roommate agreement ? Are you kidding ? We are living in a world of chaos  Roommate agreement 
label1 What's going on ?
label1 Penny  you're not trained  You're not licensed  Most importantly  you don't have access to my haircut records 
label1 Amy  what do you think ?
label1 Fine  let's go  Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch 
label1 Oh  relax  It was just her bottom and her breasts 
label1 At the end of the haircut  Mr  D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke 
label1 That's okay  I never understood them anyway 
label1 Hmm  well  it's a little Hollywood  But I think I can pull it off  Well done  Penny 
label1 Fun time  Hah  Sorry  sometimes the clippers tickle me 
label1 Movies or video games ? Or board game ? Or trading card games ? Or Lego's ? Or dress up ? Or comic books ? Or dramatic readings of novelizations ? Yes to all !
label1 The online game ? Bully !
label1 Just tell her I can't come 
label1 She's 93  She won't be disappointed for very long 
label1 I use it to get the right way  The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence 
label1 Yeah  please  Amy ! It's got lightsabres !
label1 Hello Stuart 
label1 Yes  I'm attending a party this weekend  for a 93 - year-old woman  Can you recommend a gift ?
label1 Do you supply the the tennis ball ?
label1 Then no  What else ?
label1 Well  she'd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume 
label1 No  Leonard  go ahead and mock  Like my daddy always said  Shelly  women aren't anything but flippin pains in the bottom 
label1 Well  I took out the bad words and the yeehaw  but you get the gist 
label1 Yeah  I always thought if I were ever enslaved  it would be by an advanced species from another planet  not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale 
label1 You're right  I'm smart as a whip  I should be able to figure this out 
label1 Hello  Penny  I just stopped by to bring you this gift 
label1 All right  I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante  These are Cooper Coupons  These are for various things I can do for you  Um  oh  this one is for one free grammar check  Uh  you could use it for emails  letters  tattoos  what have you  Um  oh  this is fun one  This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center  where I point out their mistakes 
label1 Oh  come on  It's just a simple favour  Now  when's the last time I asked you to do something for me ?
label1 When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn't a medical emergency ?
label1 All right  then  I have no choice but to go on to plan B 
label1 I'm going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold 
label1 All right 
label1 Oh  don't thank me  Thank wireless technology  I realized  I can go to your aunt's awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends 
label1 Oh  I got that covered  Headset  I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying 
label1 Thanks  Ooh  listen  I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake  provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry 
label1 Gentlemen  the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side  or the Sith Empire and the dark side 
label1 Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here ?
label1 Dr  Rostenkowski  it may interest you to know that saying pew  pew  pew isn't as effective as pressing your blaster key  In the same way that saying whee doesn't make the land speeder go 
label1 Hah-hah !
label1 That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced  And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine 
label1 Armin who ?
label1 I think I understand  You're the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend  but that rings hollow if you can't lord him over others in the flesh  I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave  Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution 
label1 Well played  Amy Farrah Fowler  Let me get my coat 
label1 Oh  you know what they say  the best things in life are free 
label1 Oh  that's very kind of you  Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice  I'll come a-knocking 
label1 Yeah  I hate wedding receptions  I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins  slip on the ring  disappear and everyone goes home 
label1 They had a make your own sundae bar  Ooh  that was a night to remember  Do you know  on the one trip  I just had a bowl of nuts 
label1 Howard  are you having a make your own sundae bar ?
label1 Well you should  50 % of marriages end in divorce  but 100 % of make your own sundae bars end in happiness 
label1 It's like looking at the universe naked 
label1 Knock  knock 
label1 Ah ! A vintage  mint in box  1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action  Hot-darn !
label1 Well this calls for an expression of gratitude 
label1 Not this time  Then they wouldn't be special  Thanks Penny 
label1 Look  it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure 
label1 Oh dear Lord  No !
label1 They're mint in box 
label1 Is someone there ?
label1 Spock ?
label1 But it's mint in box 
label1 Well  I'm not going to dignify that with a response 
label1 To be played with 
label1 Oh  of course  Set phasers to dumb  right ?
label1 Oh dear  Two suns and no sunscreen 
label1 What is it now  tiny Spock ?
label1 You're the one who told me to play with it 
label1 No  If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise  I would never  ever leave 
label1 I thought where you come from they don't have emotions 
label1 You know what you are ? Well  you're a green blooded buzzkill  Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here 
label1 Very well  Cooper to Enterprise  one to beam up  Energise 
label1 Nothing  I said nothing 
label1 Perhaps you should look with your eyes  and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands 
label1 My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy  which you probably did by shaking it  She shook it  We all saw her 
label1 Mmmmm !
label1 Yes  Yes  he did  that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation  Yeah  let's all be mad at Stuart 
label1 Wait  It was me  I opened your toy  discovered it was broken and didn't tell you 
label1 I didn't  That was a lie  I opened my own toy  And it was already broken so I switched them 
label1 I can't because that was a lie  Yours was broken in an earthquake  And that's a lie 
label1 My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it  And when the toy broke I switched it for yours  Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him  And then I was attacked by a Gorn 
label1 Leonard  Penny  I just  I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you  That's a lie 
label1 Okay  Leonard  even though I don't have one any more  I hope you have fun playing with it 
label1 Big fat whopper  I hope it breaks 
label1 Leonard  do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding of the Higgs boson particle  and you said  Sheldon  it's two a  m   get out of my bedroom ?
label1 Oh  okay  let me see this  All right  so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time  Now  I was thinking Howard  you go ahead and eat  This isn't going to make any sense to you 
label1 Please  please  please let me meet Hawking 
label1 And you never answered me  So who owes whom an apology now ?
label1 Um  to go to Jewish heaven ?
label1 Then to avoid Jewish hell ?
label1 Howard  please  This is Stephen Hawking  Perhaps my only intellectual equal 
label1 Try to put yourself in my place  Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs  And then it turns out there's another human being 
label1 Oh  now they're so much smarter than dogs  Have you seen them on those little bicycles ?
label1 Howard  please  I'm begging you 
label1 No  sir  no  I took my dad's desk chair  attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat  Granted most people thought I was R2 - D2  but still  I got a lot of candy 
label1 It's actually 01100111 
label1 I'm not asking for me  I'm asking for Hawking 
label1 How do I do that ?
label1 Walking away 
label1 Yes  yes  What did you decide ?
label1 Great  thank you  Oh  that's terrific 
label1 What kinds of things ?
label1 Of course 
label1 All right  What would you like me to do first ?
label1 Oh  By all means  When I was a boy  I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver  And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma  Interesting woman  You know  she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat 
label1 That's a lot of belt buckles 
label1 Oh  I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax  The man down at Pep Boys says from now on  the urine should just bead up and roll right off 
label1 What are you all staring at ? Didn't you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before ?
label1 Because if I don't  he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking  He's a famous physicist 
label1 That's close enough 
label1 Because he's punishing me for being a  quote  condescending jerk  You don't think I'm condescending  do you ?
label1 Oh  I'm sorry  condescending means '
label1 Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay 
label1 Well  I can't help it  That's an involuntary twinkle 
label1 I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason 
label1 What is it now  Mrs  Wolowitz ?
label1 What do you want me to do ?
label1 Humorous  Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking ?
label1 Oh  for heaven's sake  I did your laundry  I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles  I  I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom 
label1 You're obviously good at what you do 
label1 Now will you give my paper to Hawking ?
label1 All right  then  Thank you  Howard  Please let Professor Hawking know that I'm available at his earliest convenience 
label1 I want to thank you for taking time to see me 
label1 I know 
label1 Thank you  It just  it came to me one morning in the shower 
label1 What do you mean wrong ?
label1 No  no  th-th-th-that can't be right  I-I don't make arithmetic mistakes 
label1 Oh  no  no  no  of course not  It's just  I was thinking Oh  gosh  golly  I made a boo-boo  and I gave it to Stephen Hawking 
label1 I wish you could all be inside my head  The conversation is sparkling 
label1 Wrong  Leonard ?
label1 Wrong  and let's keep it clean  shall we ?
label1 Clever  but also wrong  No  the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself  That way  you'd be human  fungus  and algae  Triple threat  Like three-bean salad 
label1 All right  picture this  a beautiful outdoor concert  Now  as a human  I appreciate Beethoven  As a fungus  I have a terrific view  growing out of a towering maple tree  And no thank you  expensive concessions  Because as an algae  I'll just snack on this sunlight 
label1 Well  seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation  but  what do you know  you're half swan 
label1 You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom 
label1 Boo  wine ! But yay  trains  I'm in 
label1 It's not bad  Unless you compare it to a train ; then it stinks 
label1 Indeed  If I'm to participate in the social convention that is the stag night  then I must embrace all its components  including tobacco  swear words  and yes  alcohol  Jeepers ! That's yucky 
label1 I'm confused  I thought since our reconciliation  I was your friend in this group 
label1 And  apparently  Wil Wheaton's best friend 
label1 Talk to the hand 
label1 Yeah  I do 
label1 Doubleazinga ! I do ! Good luck following that 
label1 And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually  Ba-da-bazinga !
label1 Jeepers  I'm drunk 
label1 You're upset  The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage 
label1 Chicken broth  It seemed culturally appropriate  Also  there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it's been bothering me for the last eight years  So  as they say  two birds 
label1 I just threw up the bachelor party 
label1 You're kidding  Shouldn't the question be why aren't you ?
label1 Said the hangman offering a noose 
label1 Ah  much better 
label1 A little  But not more than your urethras will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them  Well  I cut quite the dashing  yet hygienic figure  don't I ? I look like the Flash about to get married  Oh ! A tissue ! A tissue ! Oh  good Lord !
label1 Keys ! Keys ! Keys !
label1 It's not an accident  I waited outside your door for twenty minutes 
label1 What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones ?
label1 Oh  dear Lord  Two years ago  we didn't even know each other  and now I'm in your apartment after dark  How much faster can this thing go ?
label1 And how do you propose to do that ? Uh  hope you're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control  Because there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys  and that's called school 
label1 Well  seems what's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock 
label1 Super Mario Bros  theme ?
label1 I see what you're doing  You're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game  admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood  but it won't work 
label1 Da-da-da da-da dum  boink  boink 
label1 You know I don't drink 
label1 I love strawberry Quik  It's my favourite pink fluid  narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol 
label1 Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it !
label1 Oh yummy  yummy ! We should do this more often  Uh-oh 
label1 Bishop to queen four  level two  Check 
label1 No  I'm having a relationship problem with Amy  And by the way  that book gave me nightmares 
label1 Look at us  Leonard  engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol ladies 
label1 Believe it or not  Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy 
label1 It's awful  This morning  she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day  It  it's usually only open to children  She got them to make an exception 
label1 They let me blow the whistle  Leonard 
label1 I know  And it gets worse  Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times 
label1 No ! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book ? For example  this morning  I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum  when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy's dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale  slightly hunched shoulders  Oh  what has that vixen done to me  Leonard ? And how do I make it stop ?
label1 I assume we're talking about you now ?
label1 So  that's how this works ? I complain  and then you complain  and no one offers any solutions ?
label1 Well  no wonder the women are winning 
label1 289  right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290 
label1 Dried potatoes  vegetable oil  corn flower  wheat starch  maltodextrin  salt  and my favourite ingredient of all  uniformity 
label1 Remarkable  In just under a half hour  200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard's keister  And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy  has been Tetris and mail-order brides 
label1 Thank you for the invitation  but I have to decline because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy 
label1 That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie  You were 114 minutes of wrong 
label1 It does  indeed  Leonard  is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her ?
label1 He asked her during coitus 
label1 Leonard  where did you envision marrying Penny ?
label1 I'll do it  provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon 
label1 What do you see in her ?
label1 You didn't have to do that 
label1 Oh  dear  I was afraid of this 
label1 While a thoughtful gift  this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars 
label1 I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars  Which places me in your debt and I can't be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move  or to kill a man 
label1 Well  what if it's his only way out ? I can't risk it  Here is twelve dollars  Now  we're even  Wait  wait  wait  I bought a card  Give me two dollars  And for the record  this is why I hate gift-giving 
label1 I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom 
label1 Fine  I'll do it in English  but it loses something  The need to find another human being to share one's life with has always puzzled me  Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself  With that being said  may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own  The Klingon would have made you cry 
label1 And the Klingon High Council '
label1 Boldly go  Howard Wolowitz 
label1 Whatever it is  we know his life will never be the same 
label1 Leonard  where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
label1 Of course  I just explained it to you  Now  where do you stand on it ?
label1 Strongly pro 
label1 Yeah  wait  Raj  where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
label1 Attaboy !
label1 Oh  Leonard  Let's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on  shall we ?
label1 As I've stated before on numerous occasions  the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken  because the last words I would hear are ' Release the Kraken  That never gets old  ' Release the Kraken ! Oh  chills  Besides  I'm having dinner with Amy 
label1 Darn  If you weren't busy  I'd ask you to join us 
label1 Oh  absolutely  I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact  but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian 
label1 Oh  I'm glad you like it  Raj picked it out 
label1 Tell him yourself 
label1 I invited him 
label1 Oh  I hope that's a rhetorical question  because I have no clue 
label1 Every time you drink alcohol 
label1 Your point being ?
label1 W-Where are you going ?
label1 You can't leave  I need you 
label1 Yes  You're my ride 
label1 All right  Please  Amy  when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine  everything feels not quite normal  because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time  I feel excited and  at the same time  terrified  The truth is  I don't know what I feel  except I know what kind of man I want to be 
label1 I should hope so  That's from the first Spider-Man movie 
label1 Good  Now  I assume we're splitting the cheque ?
label1 Okay  my turn  Let me talk to him 
label1 2311 North Los Robles Avenue  Pasadena  California to International Space Station  Can you read me ? Over 
label1 Copy that  Over 
label1 I am talking to a man in space  If you don't have the
label1 That's a negative  My mother had me tested  Over 
label1 Over and out 
label1 What are you doing here ?
label1 Excuse me  I didn't authorize this 
label1 That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner 
label1 The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five  Now  we're going to be a faceless mass of six 
label1 At the movies  Wolowitz always eats Raisinets 
label1 Well  it's hardly my business what you eat  as long as it doesn't crunch during the film and it's Raisinets 
label1 Yuh-uh  one more question  if you're going to replace Wolowitz  I need to know a little more about you 
label1 Wolowitz went to MIT  What's your educational background ?
label1 Equally ridiculous  Let's go 
label1 This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous 
label1 Yeah  of course you do  You're a girl  You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things 
label1 It's not fair  Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands 
label1 Wrong  She just took a sip from his Diet Dr  Pepper 
label1 String theory is complicated  That's just yucky  Don't get any ideas  All right  for the sake of argument  let's say that's true  Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship ?
label1 How can she not be sure how she feels ? You know  when I have a feeling  I know it  Trains ? Love them  Swordfish ? I love them  too  They're fish with a sword for a nose 
label1 Now you're asking me to keep a secret from my best friend  colleague  and roommate ?
label1 Shh  we're trying to watch the movie  This is not working out with him 
label1 I think I might have tartar buildup  My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to 
label1 Thank you  I appreciate that  You're good people  Leonard  There's something I need to tell you 
label1 I can't tell you 
label1 Good night  I'm sorry  This is really important 
label1 Leonard  the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be  You know  like  uh  a semi truck might be an alien robot  or  uh  someone in a romantic relationship  uh  might feel differently than they appear to  Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room  I'm going to pause to let that sink in 
label1 You do ?
label1 That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard 
label1 Are you sleeping ?
label1 Never mind  I still can't tell you 
label1 You frightened me 
label1 Yeah  well  I knocked on the front door  but you didn't hear it 
label1 Yeah  really ? I've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years  but when I do it  it's weird ?
label1 Oh  I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought  uh  seeing as you're up  we could talk 
label1 Oh  I don't know  uh  weather  uh  fish you could do carpentry with  why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend  Yeah  pick one  your choice 
label1 Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that ? Hubba-hubba 
label1 Yeah  Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country  in today's North Korea  he's downright average  Hey  talk about a keeper 
label1 Oh  very well  I can't keep up this clever charade any longer  She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard 
label1 Excuse me  This is not about protecting my friend  I'm a big fan of homeostasis  Do you know what that is ?
label1 Homeostasis refers to a system's ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH 
label1 My point is I don't like when things change  So  regardless of your feelings  I would like you to continue dating Leonard  And also  while we're on the subject  you recently changed your shampoo  I'm not comfortable with the new scent  Please stop this madness and go back to green apple 
label1 I do  You clear on the shampoo issue ?
label1 Penny ?
label1 Thank you  Coconut ? What were you thinking ? Are you a hula girl ?
label1 Yeah  just a heads-up : Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard  She's pretty mad 
label1 All right then  so we're all on the same page  Yes 
label1 I'm sorry  Wolowitz would never play that card 
label1 Fairy God Monster  I win  Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak 
label1 Leonard ? Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls 
label1 Yeah  for now  But that woman has a death wish  Leonard  She talks to strangers  she pets unfamiliar dogs  and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment  If I were you  I'd get a back-up 
label1 But  then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers  and he was even better 
label1 Call me a romantic  I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere 
label1 Yeah  settle down there  fake Wolowitz  No one likes a kiss-up 
label1 Oh  thank you  Penny 
label1 Yeah  wait  here  For your troubles 
label1 Yeah  it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child 
label1 No  that's my potty training journal 
label1 Yeah  And forgive my crude penmanship  I didn't start typing until I was six 
label1 There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape  colour and consistency 
label1 I am glad you asked  Are you familiar with the Higgs boson ?
label1 Yeah  the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago  so that got me thinking  perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize 
label1 Well  this box only covers my work through nursery school  There's a good deal more to come  I didn't really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors 
label1 That's a good point  My time is much too valuable  You know  perhaps I should find someone to do it for me  You know  someone with a rudimentary understanding of science  but whose real talents lie in menial labour 
label1 You  really ? You can assess the quality of my work ? Okay  um  here  I wrote this when I was five years old 
label1 You said it  not me 
label1 All right  Ms  Jenson  Uh  before we begin  may I offer you a refreshment ? Water  coffee  tea  a marijuana cigarette ?
label1 Now  are you sure ? Everyone's smoking them  I think they're the best 
label1 Excellent  yeah  That was a ruse  They're not the best  Physics is the best  And by the way  coffee was also an unacceptable choice  All right  so I see here you're from Des Moines  Iowa  Uh  you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University  Oh  and two years ago  you had a persistent ear infection  I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss 
label1 Hearing unimpaired  good 
label1 Flattery will not get you this job  Ms  Jenson 
label1 Oh  well  thank you  Welcome aboard 
label1 No  I have people for that now  You're up 
label1 Yeah  please reserve chitchat for your breaks  Ms  Jenson  FYI  there will be no breaks 
label1 Oh  in fact  she has  Uh  her exact words were  what is that guy's problem ?
label1 Half chocolate  half vanilla  side by side  not swirled ?
label1 Half a teaspoon of sprinkles ?
label1 Two cherries ?
label1 Stems removed ?
label1 It's all right  Alex  I'm not mad at you  I'm just disappointed 
label1 Uh  Alex  a moment  I need a word with Dr  Hofstadter  Do you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us  given her station ?
label1 If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS  it's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind 
label1 It's a kindness  Leonard  Otherwise  you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips 
label1 I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize  Behold 
label1 The original title was ' A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism ' I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch 
label1 Notice people on your own time  We're working 
label1 Yeah  you had a good run  Fake Wolowitz  We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness  the way we do the dial-up modem  the VHS tape  or  or Leonard's gym membership 
label1 Well  I don't sell my friendship that cheaply 
label1 Welcome aboard  old chum 
label1 He left a boy  he returns a boy-sized hero 
label1 Yes  it's just that in all the years I've known him  he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration  I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened 
label1 I know 
label1 Oh  that hardly seems fair  But I guess any team that I'm not on has a decided disadvantage 
label1 Yeah  once again  I know 
label1 Got it 
label1 Oh  Leonard  Now  how can you not get that ?
label1 It's not a present  it's the present  Look  There's you and me  There's Penny and Amy  We're playing Pictionary  In the present 
label1 It's a quark-gluon plasma 
label1 It's asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma 
label1 Yeah  only after I eliminated all the obvious answers  You're welcome 
label1 Come on  Leonard  I am spoon-feeding this to you 
label1 Wait  no  no  No  The word is Polish  See  look  Polish sausage  And the  the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus  a Polish astronomer  And then  finally  if that wasn't enough  which it should have been  this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium  who  although she was a naturalized French citizen  was Polish by birth 
label1 Ah  So it is  I guess we both share blame on this one 
label1 Don't know 
label1 I am not a loser  Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill 
label1 Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie 
label1 All right  Let's play Physics Fiesta 
label1 It's a game that I just invented  in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish  Um  ' D'nde est el boson de Higgs ?
label1 Bueno  mi amigo 
label1 All games are made up  They're not found in nature  You don't just dig in the ground  come across a rich vein of Rock'em Sock'em Robots 
label1 That is true  I have a higher than normal body density  If I run too deep a bath  I drown 
label1 No  that's not fair either 
label1 Darts is a bar game  You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age 
label1 Well  regardless  she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions  Pool  beer pong  wet T-shirt contests  they're all out 
label1 Hurry up  find him  find him 
label1 How could you not find him ?
label1 Stop that 
label1 Amy  do something  Amy  help  Amy  stop that  Amy  Penny  both of you  stop it 
label1 Wait  I'm a little concerned  Blueberries are rich in antioxidants 
label1 So  with all those antioxidants  what if I run out of oxidants ?
label1 That's rude 
label1 Oh  ow  blueberry in my nose  blueberry in my nose !
label1 For the record  he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world 
label1 Interesting hypothesis  Let's apply the scientific method  perform an experiment 
label1 Two tea bags in one cup ? You're not at a rave 
label1 I couldn't agree more 
label1 Oh  oh  on the contrary  Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship  Now imagine this  you and I entering Stuart's party and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved and glamorous couple 
label1 R2 - D2 and C - 3PO  Dibs on Threepio 
label1 Okay  I'm gonna let that slide because I know you're hopped up on tea bags 
label1 Night of the Living Garlic Bread ?
label1 I'm sorry  but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns  The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie 
label1 A Tardis makes no sense  It's a time machine from a science-fiction show  It has nothing to do with Halloween  That being said  if you don't get a Tardis  you stink and your party stinks 
label1 Yes ! This party just became a major rager 
label1 We seem to have different approaches here  I was going for helpful honesty  I have no idea what you're doing 
label1 Okay  If you think being nice will get him to shut up  I'll try it 
label1 Look at that  the problem solved itself 
label1 No  I don't think so  Those dolls represent three things I do not care for  clowns  children and raggediness  I think it's a lost cause 
label1 I should've picked hickey 
label1 It was a compromise  I lost 
label1 Paradigm-shifting news  gentlemen 
label1 Earlier today  I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends  Moments ago  he accepted my request  Do you understand what that means ?
label1 Friends ! It's Words with Friends ! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are  Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide  I'll have everything I've ever wanted since I was six years old 
label1 And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With  you'll be off to the races 
label1 Yes  I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points  That ought to let the air out of your tyres  Hawking 
label1 It is glorious  One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits  And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down 
label1 It's been three days  Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word ?
label1 Not challenging ? I was humiliating the man  I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl 
label1 Good Lord  what have I done ?
label1 Play  Play  Play  Play  Play 
label1 Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking  Play  Play  Ugh ! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something 
label1 Then suffer in silence  Play  Play  Play 
label1 I was beating him so bad  he doesn't want to be friends anymore  Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking ?
label1 How would I know ? I'm not listening to you 
label1 I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends  He stopped playing  and now we're not friends anymore 
label1 Wolowitz told me he's a big baby  But I didn't know that  and I played extract for 82 points  It's all Amy's fault  She told me to play it  I have got to cut her loose 
label1 Yeah  I hear you  brother 
label1 Fine  Women  huh ?
label1 It sucks to be you 
label1 Leonard  wait  No  I listened to your dumb thing  Leonard  come back  Leonard  come back  Leonard  come back 
label1 Oh  of course  it only works on the weak-minded 
label1 No  It would appear as if I've lost him  Stupid brain 
label1 How can it be okay ? Stephen Hawking's a genius and he talks like a robot  It's everything I've ever wanted in a friend 
label1 Yeah  way ahead of you  I will play the word at for two measly points  throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world 
label1 I can't  Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest 
label1 Oh  but I want to be Hawking's friend 
label1 Oh  but if I do  I'll be a phony  a sellout  a Hollywood poser 
label1 I won't  This feels right  My mother always said  to thine own self be true 
label1 She sounds exactly like you 
label1 It's Stephen Hawking 
label1 Oh  me  too 
label1 Yes  congratulations  You won fair and square  Uh  very impressive  sir 
label1 Oh  I love brain teasers 
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags  Before we get started  I'd like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition  But I can't  The only entry was from GameyGamer 75  and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks  Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise  Star Trek  And to help me  I'm pleased to introduce Internet personality  former star of Star Trek : The Next Generation  and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale  Set phasers to fun for my friend  Wil Wheaton 
label1 What's wrong ?
label1 My friend  Wil Wheaton 
label1 So  Wil  what do you have for us first ?
label1 It's true  In 1982  Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH  You moved me 
label1 So  Wil  what do you have for us first ?
label1 Really ? He reminded me of a young William Shatner 
label1 Well  you're my girlfriend and I don't want you to be upset  Then again  Wil Wheaton's my friend and I don't want him to be upset  Hmm  this is a sticky wicket 
label1 I'll be right back  Feel free to play with yourself 
label1 Amy  I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave  He's a minor celebrity  Once you explain who he is  many people recognize him 
label1 Come to think of it  I would ! You  little lady  are on fire 
label1 Yeah  I did  but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S  She got huffy and left  then Wil and I headed out to dinner  That place really did remind me of my hometown  Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet 
label1 Yes  quite the kerfuffle 
label1 Walked right out the door 
label1 Why's that ?
label1 Fine  It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us  because the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves humble pie  a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt  I was this close 
label1 You'll appreciate this  Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me  Tell him you're not mad at me  Go ahead  set him straight 
label1 Hmm  Eat one of your Luna bars  Very often when women think they're angry  they're really just hungry 
label1 Wow  Amy's mad and Leonard was right  What a weird day 
label1 I've been thinking about what happened  and I hope this gift will make things better 
label1 Penny  please  I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma  And for the record  I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19 
label1 Well  it's been a rough day  I usually go chamomile tea  but I don't think that's going to cut it 
label1 The trouble isn't with me  Penny  it's with your gender  Someday  scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle 
label1 It's a Band-Aid at best  See  the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other  Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me  And I like them  which indicates they're bright and interesting and / or were on Star Trek 
label1 Not true  Leonard made me like you  And let me tell you  that was a hard row to hoe  Cheers  pal  Ooh  Boy  that is a treat that's hard to beat  Get the Mad Hatter on the horn  I'm having a tea party 
label1 I drink tea all the time  I think I know what I'm doing 
label1 My problem is I'm out of tea 
label1 Penny  please  I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing 
label1 On the other hand  that low-down polecat done wronged my woman 
label1 Amy deserves better  You know  when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix  she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them  She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel 
label1 I'm a callous egomaniac  She's gonna leave me 
label1 No  she won't  I'm great 
label1 Wouldn't you like to know ?
label1 Just tea  S'the best tea I've ever had 
label1 I'll tell you  I'm from Texas  Need I say more ?
label1 You insulted my woman  I'm here to defend her honour  Two ! It was two 
label1 My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant invisible cow  They're up to beat an apology out of you 
label1 Well  that was a long bus ride for not very much 
label1 You're asking a lot of questions  Wil Wheaton  As a matter of idle curiosity  which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting ? Never mind  I'll choose 
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags  Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise  Star Trek  And to help us  I'm pleased to introduce a special guest  surprisingly  it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here  Mr  LeVar Burton 
label1 I don't know what she's talking about  but I'm obligated to agree with her  She's my girlfriend 
label1 It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole  Leonard  You can block it with a Frisbee  Calm down 
label1 It's a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe 
label1 Oh  hello 
label1 No  thank you 
label1 I'm quite sure  Good day 
label1 Where are you going ?
label1 To be honest  I didn't know you were here 
label1 Oh  I don't know  I mean  statistically speaking  I'm sure you have something to worry about 
label1 Well  if we assume your looks are average  yeah  right off the bat  fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you  That's one point five billion handsome lads standing by  waiting to rain on your parade 
label1 Not height  vision  athleticism  or ability to digest dairy products 
label1 I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities  Your choice of friends is impeccable  you're a good sleeper  and last but not least  you buy the grapes I like  You're a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes 
label1 Well  unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist 
label1 While unlikely  it's still a statistical possibility  She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it 
label1 Am I ? The mind's a mysterious thing  Leonard  He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn 
label1 I thought you left a long time ago 
label1 Sorry ? You may not realize it  but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life  You know  understanding sarcasm  feigning interest in others  not talking about trains as much as I want to  It's exhausting  Which is why  for twenty minutes a day  I like to go down to that room  turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge 
label1 You don't need to know  you don't deserve to know  and you will never know 
label1 If a zombie bites you  you turn into a zombie  However  if a mummy bites you  all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite  So  like a zombie  that's been eaten from the waist down  you  sir  have no leg to stand on 
label1 Oh  thank you 
label1 I'm sorry  294 ?
label1 That's my parking spot 
label1 It doesn't matter  That's my spot 
label1 Well  I'm not using my nipples  either  Maybe they should reassign those 
label1 I don't want another parking space  I want my parking space  It's perfect  It's a corner spot  cutting the risk of door-dings in half  It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance  The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel  Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks 
label1 Don't try to change the subject  This is about a parking space  It has nothing to do with cars 
label1 I always listen to myself  It's one of the great joys of my life  Now  get your car out of my spot 
label1 Very well  You leave me no choice 
label1 What are you looking at  you stupid squirrel ?
label1 Yeah  that was five weeks ago  How much longer is he gonna milk that cow ?
label1 No  no  this is a slippery slope  Leonard  It starts with a parking space  where does it end ? It's like my dad always said  first they say you can't drink and drive  next thing you know  you can't let your 10 - year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat 
label1 Leonard  you're my best friend  Why don't you ever take my side ?
label1 Oh  that  Well  see  I wanted it  and you weren't using it  Apparently  those are the rules we live by now  Payback  it truly is the B word  isn't it ?
label1 I'd love to help you out  but unfortunately
label1 Go ahead  That's the only doctorate you'll ever get  It smells funny in here 
label1 Cookie 
label1 Well  I'm not giving it away 
label1 He's in my spot  Leonard  make him stop being naked in my spot 
label1 Get off there 
label1 Give me back my parking space 
label1 Keep a lookout  This place is swarming with campus security  They will not hesitate to scold us 
label1 Oh  yeah  Okay  now  pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here 
label1 Yes  and be sure and put on the emergency brake  Really makes these things tough to budge 
label1 All right  colour me intrigued 
label1 Oh  You said I'm not using my space  so I'm using it 
label1 No  I don't 
label1 Actually  I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can  Give up  Wolowitz  You've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can't defeat  There is nothing you could possibly do to
label1 Oh  yes  they are  I mean  what ?
label1 Your threats are empty  nothing can move me 
label1 Oh  preposterous  I have been solely responsible for this university's six loop quantum gravity calculations  I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates  and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine  Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space  Now  if you'll excuse me  I have work to do 
label1 Just breaking in your new car 
label1 You know what they say ? Revenge is a dish best served nude 
label1 Well  Howard  thank you  It's quite a gesture on your part  You've shown yourself to be the bigger man 
label1 Which I find totally unacceptable  I must be the bigger man  Therefore  you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile 
label1 Yes  According to information I gleaned from Yelp  you had great success when a santeriasuzy 37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood  I believe I may have a similar problem  This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle 
label1 Lipid residue  An anal autograph  A colon calling card  if you will 
label1 Don't rush it  We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level 
label1 Is that your son ?
label1 Looks like that laptop's seen better days  If you're interested  I'm selling this  It's only two years old  16 gigabytes of RAM  Intel core i7 processor  and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut's penis 
label1 Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song ?
label1 However  the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man  Spider-Man does whatever a spider can 
label1 I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can  One  crawl in your ear and die  Two  legally leave Guatemala without a passport  Three  have sex with a spider 
label1 You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station ? I bring up an interesting topic  like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders 
label1 Sadly  yes  Amy's taking me to a memorial service  It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent  so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave  he'll never make his way back to China 
label1 What can I say ? I put the fun in funeral 
label1 I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie  but you can wear a bathrobe ?
label1 You're sick ? You poor kid  Well  see ya 
label1 Me ? No  No  I'm not that kind of doctor 
label1 You're welcome  Now let's get this over with 
label1 1022  Exactly what it was half an hour ago  It's like you're not even trying to get better 
label1 Well  not with that attitude 
label1 I'm sorry  I just want you to get better as soon as possible  And with that goal in mind  let me ask you a question  Do you believe in the placebo effect ?
label1 Great  Now  this may look like a Tic Tac  but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath 
label1 Yes  All over it 
label1 No  I need to get you down for a nap  And for some reason  that VapoRub gets you all fired up 
label1 Oh  I'm hanging in there  Thanks for asking 
label1 Uh  I'm going to draw you a soothing bath  Where's your bath thermometer ?
label1 Fine  Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature 
label1 I'm surprised to hear that  See  the other day  I was concerned that you weren't recovering  so while you were sleeping  I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab 
label1 I got the results back  Have you developed any of the following symptoms ? A growing nose  or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region ? Also known as full-blown liar  liar  pants on fire 
label1 It hurts that you would lie to me  Amy  I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour 
label1 It pains me to say it  but I think some form of penalty is in order  so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future 
label1 In a perfect world  I'd lock you in a stockade in the public square  That probably requires a permit 
label1 Are you prepared to receive your punishment ?
label1 Maybe I will 
label1 Yeah  oh  I'm sorry  I should've mentioned this earlier  You're not invited 
label1 Amy  from time to time  we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves 
label1 Yeah  like a bunch of savages 
label1 A Christmas gift ? You know I don't enjoy Christmas 
label1 Oh  where to begin ? Trees indoors  Overuse of the words ' tis and ' twas  And the absurd custom of one stocking  Everyone knows socks belong in pairs  Who uses one sock ?
label1 Actually that helps  thank you 
label1 Oh  a scroll  I like scrolls  They're my third favourite system of transmitting the written word  After stone tablets and skywriting  You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure  Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred  I like where this is heading  Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres  Oh  that's a saucy twist  That leader's name  Santa Claus  No  no  no 
label1 Fun ? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly  the best-tasting jelly  and petroleum jelly  the worst-tasting jelly 
label1 I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy 
label1 I know they're making a rhetorical point  I just don't know what it is 
label1 Wait  Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia 
label1 Wait  wait  Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol 
label1 Good King Wenceslas looked out  on the feast of Stephen  When the snow lay ' round about  deep and crisp and even
label1 Brightly shone the moon that night  though the frost was cruel  When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel 
label1 It was simple  I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents  Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop  singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos 
label1 W-W-Wait  There's still four more verses  You don't sing a song and not finish it  Hither  page  and stand by me  if thou know'st it  telling  Yonder peasant  who is he ? Where and what his dwelling ? Brightly shone the moon that night  though the frost '
label1 Ye who now will bless the poor  shall yourselves find blessing  Ba-da-bum 
label1 I think the word you're looking for is bravo 
label1 Melted snowmen ? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water ?
label1 What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes ?
label1 Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink ? Eggs are available all year ' round  I've been known to enjoy this poolside 
label1 Oh  don't be silly  Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry  Why is this so important to you ?
label1 No wonder you love Christmas  That sounds amazing 
label1 Yeah  I'm familiar with your work  C-minus was your gift 
label1 All right  I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge 
label1 But first  I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard 
label1 You can't talk  you're paralyzed  I get right up in Santa's big  fat face and say  well  well  well  jolly old Saint Nick  we meet again  Yeah  I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston  Texas  when I was five years old  isn't that right ?
label1 My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas  And I told you  my Pop-Pop  because that was the year my grandfather died  I missed him and I wanted him back 
label1 Santa ?
label1 I understand 
label1 Oh  I hope it's a train 
label1 I'm getting three trains 
label1 Wait  uh  uh  hang on  In my defense '
label1 Well  I must say  Leonard  when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga  I was sceptical 
label1 No  I was wrong  The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice  I've never felt so alive 
label1 Well  you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep ? Well  it occurred to me that  like most things I say  it's probably pure gold  So I started recording it all  and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark 
label1 Jenga  I win !
label1 Ah  gentlemen  what is on the conversational menu this morning ?
label1 Well  that's not acceptable  I mean  I'm her boss  She needs to be solely focused on my needs  not distracted by your pasty  androgynous brand of sexuality 
label1 Oh  please  Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips 
label1 I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice  Uh  in the past  I've reached out to each of you individually  but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group  which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies 
label1 I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation  Uh  to protect those involved  I'll be changing their names 
label1 Well  a short  bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate  Let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally 
label1 No  no  Shilly-Shally has red hair and  uh  he briefly served in the Mexican Navy  Anyway  despite the fact that he has a girlfriend  Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady 
label1 No  uh  no  I'm sorry  Who's talking about Leonard and Alex ?
label1 Okay  look  it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya  It is really about her boss  who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice  which is surprising because Dr  Einstein Von Brainstorm  he's usually pretty smart about these things 
label1 Ladies  ladies  please  We're not here to talk about Penny  okay ? We're here to talk about me  Uh  I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm  Oh  darn it ! All right  I guess the cat's out of the bag  Let me explain what's going on  Ricardo is really Leonard 
label1 Well  what should I do ?
label1 Oh  no  he's not uncomfortable at all  No  he's loving it  Yeah  he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six 
label1 Alex  check my schedule  What does my afternoon look like ?
label1 Well  that snuck up on us  didn't it ?
label1 Let's not call it a problem  Let's call it an opportunity  To solve a serious problem 
label1 You don't know ? Oh  you poor dear  Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up  You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr  Hofstadter 
label1 Now  there's no need to get defensive  I'm not unsympathetic to your plight  My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day 
label1 Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time 
label1 So does this fellow  but he can't without it burning like hot soup 
label1 Oh  yes  Yeah  and a fat lot of good it did me  All she did was get mad at you 
label1 I needed advice about a woman  I would have asked you  but if the last few years have proven anything  it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle 
label1 Good to know  Yeah  a few more helpful hints like that  you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies  ( Answering phone ) Hello  I see  Uh  what time ? Very well  then  Huh  That was the Human Resources Department at the university  Apparently  my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace 
label1 Hmm  let me think  Nothing  I'm a delight 
label1 ( Knock  knock  knock ) Human Resources Department  ( Knock  knock  knock ) Human Resources Department  ( Knock  knock  knock ) Human Resources Department 
label1 So I've been told  But I can't understand what she has to complain about  I mean  she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history  There's string cheese in my mini-fridge  and that's for anyone  Yeah  and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia 
label1 Like what ?
label1 Well  y-you  I-I'm just saying  you know  at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle '
label1 Yes  No  yeah  but in his defense  that wasn't racist  He's also brown 
label1 Well  hello 
label1 Actually  I came to speak to Mrs  Davis 
label1 But I came to file a complaint  Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature 
label1 And thanks to you  I know better than to ask if you're menstruating  And based on your behaviour  I don't have to 
label1 Yeah  Now  unfortunately  uh  my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this  so  um  I'm gonna need you to take it for me  Oh  and  uh  you'd better ace it  they're pretty mad 
label1 It's a comic book convention  You know  it's like pizza or particle accelerators  even the stinky one's still pretty good 
label1 But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on  I know I'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option  I love the turn-by-turn voice option 
label1 Ooh  sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about  I'd put on my listening ears if I were you 
label1 Shh  he said it's interesting 
label1 Yeah  well luckily  someone in the car does 
label1 None of you will get it  It's Eisenhower 
label1 I know Mr  Data isn't supposed to smile  but here it comes 
label1 Mr  Data's weapon is his mind  I'm wielding it 
label1 Nope  The only thing left to do now is assign blame  (
label1 What kind of person leaves his keys in the car ?
label1 You're right  Nice going 
label1 Well  perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence 
label1 What  you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform  you're in charge ?
label1 All right 
label1 Gentlemen  a little less bellyaching  We're Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective 
label1 Leonard  all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love  And look at us  At this moment  we are  in fact  a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment  relying only on our wits  our fortitude and our moxie  As long as we have those things  nothing can stop '
label1 I hate this planet 
label1 Scotty was on the original series  and we're Next Generation  So  joke's on you 
label1 Actually  it's three against one 
label1 Yeah  well  we're not  We're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots  And to tell you the truth  I'm starting to feel like one  I want to go home now 
label1 Well  I say that's the last time we ever go outside 
label1 There's only one logical explanation  Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature 
label1 Captain  what are your orders ?
label1 I'll eat later  Right now  I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics 
label1 Don't waste my time 
label1 A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board  He makes his move  He's dividing both sides by I  He's adding back the coefficient  He has a value for P  He's plugging that back in  He takes the derivative  and he solves the equation  The crowd goes wild  Nobel ! Nobel !
label1 Nobel  Kripke  Don't look at my board 
label1 That's a drawing of a really cool train  Don't look at that  either  What do you want ?
label1 So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out  That's hard cheese  Barry  You're one of the good ones 
label1 That's ridiculous  I am one of the great minds of our generation  I work on a level so rarified you couldn't even imagine it  I said stop looking at my cool train !
label1 There is ominous music playing  and there is an afghan over my head  I don't know where you're from  but where I'm from  that means I'm not doing okay 
label1 Tea is for when I'm upset  I'm not upset  The university's forcing me to work with Kripke  I'm outraged 
label1 Yes  cocoa  Do you have any idea what it's like to be paired with someone who's so incredibly annoying ?
label1 See  I did all this great work  and now he's just going to come along and ruin it  I am angrier than ever and filled with despair 
label1 Yes  hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks !
label1 And yet  now you're in my office  Point  Cooper  Welcome to the Thunderdome  Kripke 
label1 How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own ?
label1 Because I'm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine  Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome  Barry 
label1 And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here 
label1 Very well 
label1 I'm fine 
label1 I read his research  and  it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine  Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought  It's his mommy 
label1 What do we have to lose ?
label1 I can't go in today  I'm sick 
label1 No  look 
label1 Oh  dear  Now I'm not even smarter than you 
label1 Oh  don't play the Einstein card  His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything  So everything was a great breakthrough 
label1 All right  geez  What a grouch 
label1 We do ?
label1 What can I say  you know ? She enjoys my genitals  I am giving them to her on a nightly basis 
label1 I'll do what I can  But it's not going to be easy  because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together  boy howdy  is it magic
label1 Because the truth made me look bad  whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good  Anyway  if Kripke asks  tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent  intense and whimsically inventive 
label1 Of course 
label1 That's awfully personal 
label1 Well  word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling 
label1 Penny  all my life  I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others  hand-shaking  hugging  prostate exams  But I'm working on it  you know ? Just recently  I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest  A year ago  that would have been unthinkable 
label1 It's a possibility 
label1 Well  the equation balances  but it's certainly not elegant 
label1 No  I gave it to her well  Now  over here  I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put '
label1 I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body 
label1 Can we get back to work ?
label1 Toys ? I do have a model rocket next to my bed 
label1 That's a good one  Dumbledore dies in that one  Yeah  I know  I didn't see it coming  either 
label1 You brought up the subject  I contributed an interesting fact on that subject  It's called the art of conversation  Okay  your turn 
label1 Oh  really  Leonard ? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits ?
label1 Yes  and I have a theory why  Because of your lactose intolerance  you switched over to soy milk  Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds  I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman 
label1 There you go again  nag  nag  nag  You're only proving my point  little lady 
label1 What ? I'm annoying ? You criticize my behaviour all the time  Sheldon  don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast  Sheldon  when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral  don't yawn and point at your watch  Sheldon  don't throw away my shirts ' cause you think they're ugly  You're impossible 
label1 Actually  I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do 
label1 You pick that up right now 
label1 Roommate agreement  section 27  paragraph 5  the roommate agreement  like the American flag  cannot touch the ground 
label1 Where are you going ?
label1 Crazy bastard ?
label1 Leonard  wait 
label1 Dobby the elf dies in book seven 
label1 One vintage Mr  Mxyzptlk action figure  That's Leonard's 
label1 One Star Trek : The Next Generation phaser  That's Leonard's 
label1 One Game of Thrones collector's edition Longclaw sword  Oh  Leonard and I bought that together  That's a bit of an ethical conundrum  Eh  I'll keep it 
label1 Oh  it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule  He would just go whenever the mood struck him 
label1 Exactly 
label1 Wait  Here who is where ?
label1 Hey  good buddy  So  uh  I was just talking to Amy  and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing 
label1 Yes  All is forgiven  so come back home  I'll make you some soy hot chocolate  and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy 
label1 Okay  Amy's decided she wants to move in with me  so I need you to come back home  you lovable scamp  That's a lot of product 
label1 Leonard  please  You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for 
label1 Feelings ? What am I  a hippie at a love-in ? No  The problem is  she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn't refute 
label1 You gave Leonard somewhere to go  Thanks to you  Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels  Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it 
label1 Great  Kick him out  Break his heart  Everybody wins 
label1 Hold on  If you don't want to live with Leonard  why don't you just tell him ?
label1 That's because he drinks too much soy milk 
label1 Is it kung pao chicken ?
label1 Brown rice  not white rice ?
label1 Spicy mustard from the Korean deli ?
label1 Yes  Amy  are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship ?
label1 Yeah  why would you ?
label1 Hello  This is Sheldon 
label1 We're not home right now 
label1 No  It's not the message 
label1 You did 
label1 I said the truth  You don't want to live with Leonard  and you know it 
label1 Yeah  I think we should talk about that 
label1 I thought we were talking about the other thing 
label1 Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead ?
label1 Have you seen the one where Lori dies ?
label1 Or maybe she doesn't  Let's find out 
label1 So  in conclusion  I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste 
label1 Oh  you caught that  did you ?
label1 Ah  Alex  excellent  I have a research problem that I believe you can help with 
label1 Oh  no  no  That's not going to happen  no  What I need you to do is find a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend 
label1 Well  I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents  Now  here is  let's see  this is  this is about two thousand dollars  um  I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey  Contribute to my work  Ah  kids say the darnedest things 
label1 Now  see  I never would have thought to do that  Clearly  I made a good choice farming this out to you  But I am telling you  Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot  Anyway  my socks are on  Let's knock them off 
label1 Now  Amy already has a real harp  And it can play any song  What are you trying to pull here ?
label1 But she's got Google Maps on her phone 
label1 Wow  Oh  this is truly remarkable 
label1 I think I'll keep it for myself 
label1 It's too late  I call dibs 
label1 Okay  Shall we go to dinner ?
label1 Yes  and as you know  I planned to pretend to enjoy it  I've been working on this facial expression all day 
label1 Really ?
label1 More than anything 
label1 Well  I don't know what to say  This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me  And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today 
label1 No  No  after everything you didn't do for me tonight  I want you to have it 
label1 Read it 
label1 At the bottom 
label1 Well  I thought  if I have a stroke or a kidney stone  who would I want to share that with ?
label1 It's like you said  you're my girlfriend 
label1 Yeah  Okay  Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza 
label1 So  Penny  I understand you would like to learn more about flags 
label1 Yeah  Well  you came to the right place 
label1 Interesting  A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic  Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like 
label1 Right  And which one do I want ?
label1 If our friend  the flag  has taught me anything  it's to go where the wind takes you  As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole  And  action  So  Penny  what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night ?
label1 Gosh  Penny  what'd you have for breakfast ? A big glass of good question juice ? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue  Spread your legs  invite them in 
label1 Hello  How's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going ?
label1 Good news  Uh  the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online 
label1 I know  I'm still learning to control it 
label1 Why would I do that ?
label1 All right 
label1 No  I didn't start yet  it's fine 
label1 Yes  you were very natural in front of the camera  and I found your suggestions extremely helpful 
label1 Oh  that sounds terrible  Why would I want to do that ?
label1 Well  so much for your advice on complimenting Penny 
label1 She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play  Don't worry  Luckily  I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river 
label1 Oh  so many crazy rules 
label1 Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me  I'm obligated to do something nice for you  So  yes  I'll go to your dopey play 
label1 Why not ?
label1 Oh  Dear Lord  more rules ? Where does it stop ? Can I want to go because I have to want to go ?
label1 Yeah  but now  wait  Do whatever I want ? Or whatever I have to want ?
label1 All right  I don't want to  but at least that makes sense 
label1 You know  I haven't seen Raj in several days  Is he no longer a part of our social group ? And if so  should we be interviewing for a replacement ? Perhaps  this time  we go Latin 
label1 Oh  brilliant  I've been itching to pull that trigger 
label1 Would it help if I gave him some pointers ? I'm just funnin ya 
label1 All right  let's get this stupid play over with 
label1 She is  But when do they get to the part about streetcars ?
label1 She's remarkable 
label1 How can she remember all those lines  but as a waitress  she can't remember no tomato on my hamburger ?
label1 I got the B word 
label1 If you ask me  this whole thing is a waste of our time 
label1 Helping anyone  People should take care of themselves 
label1 I think that's incredibly sexist of you  I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek  where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals 
label1 Howard's disturbing recollections aside  I don't appreciate being forced to do banal committee work 
label1 Exactly  It's like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito 
label1 I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged  Harry Potter's J  K  Rowling  uh  Star Trek's D  C  Fontana 
label1 We're not  This time you're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch 
label1 No  you're a tool I was using to make my point 
label1 How is it sexist ? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man 
label1 Mother  warrior-princess  franchise owner  I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town 
label1 All your ideas address the issue at a university level  By then it's too late  You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences 
label1 Oh  hold on  While I'm comfortable speaking about science  I'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren  Better Google it 
label1 How do I get 12 - year-old girls excited 
label1 This must feel pretty good for you  coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut 
label1 Smart  We don't want any problems 
label1 Uh  hello again  Um  yeah  I don't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences  but it's clear you young women here  today  have been  While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time  it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science  and  uh  I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now  Uh  Dr  Rostenkowski  Dr  Fowler  are you there ?
label1 Heard you the first time 
label1 Oh  you shouldn't have 
label1 No  you really shouldn't have  I brought my own 
label1 Howard  did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour ?
label1 Wrong  they'll be arranged seasonally 
label1 Yeah  and some thanks I got  The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami 
label1 Oh  five more minutes 
label1 Please  Leonard  he said it's okay 
label1 Howard  I have a few questions  I found three bowling pins  Now  do you juggle these  or are you missing seven ?
label1 You health nuts kill me 
label1 Uh  just a couple more items  Howard  I found this letter from your dad in a box  Now  based on the content  it could either be filed '
label1 Wait  can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride ?
label1 Bleuch  Like cleaning out the entire building's belly button 
label1 Oh  dear  My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city 
label1 Oh  Oh  I've got that in spades  Ravage me 
label1 I can't tell you that  I'm bound by closet organizer / organizee confidentiality 
label1 Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard  By happenstance  I came to know it  That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely 
label1 Are you pointing out that California is a community property state  and since Howard and Bernadette are married  the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses ?
label1 Well played  Sometimes I don't give you enough credit  Penny 
label1 Oh  Leonard  If I was prone to sarcasm  I'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets 
label1 Oh  Yeah  well  I was waylaid by Penny  Bernadette and Amy  They made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father 
label1 Sorry  badgering me won't work  What you should have said is  It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us 
label1 All right  I'll tell you  My goodness  everyone's on their game today 
label1 If I say yes  can we turn off that Latin orgy music ?
label1 I panicked  He looked taller than usual 
label1 It's simple  really  It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition  The  the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once 
label1 It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy 
label1 I would like to change mine  The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine  Now it's completely different from Goonies 
label1 You know  surprisingly  uh  the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing I read in the closet  Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages 
label1 Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review 
label1 Well  now  did you also have a dog ? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy 
label1 If I could keep my Gmail account  I'd be okay with that 
label1 If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish  I'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle 
label1 Excuse me  the whole tenure system is ridiculous  A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent  If we really want science to advance  people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid 
label1 Pchew !
label1 Pchew ! Pchew ! Pchew ! Pchew !
label1 Mm-hmm 
label1 Well put  You know  I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing  but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running 
label1 My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact  I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow  Or a chainsaw 
label1 Or  the chainsaw 
label1 Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy 
label1 Even you  You're a slave 
label1 It's too late  Get ready to like me 
label1 The tragic history of slavery in America  Fun for the whole family 
label1 Barely knew him 
label1 I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday  so  bad news for you 
label1 First of all  when you say things like that  people think you're crazy  Second  the reason I'm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman 
label1 Eh  it will be  Honestly  if I must endure a long and tedious evening  I'd rather it be with you on date night  But I have no choice  The tenure committee's going to be there 
label1 Well  now that I think about it  that would be most helpful 
label1 Bad  However '
label1 Fine  Bad 
label1 You're here 
label1 So am I  His passing makes me feel bad 
label1 What are you going to do ? Take people's drink orders and get them wrong ?
label1 What ? Did she do it yet ?
label1 Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit ?
label1 Okay  because that was not clear 
label1 What ? That was ambiguous 
label1 Well  yes  of course  he wouldn't like that at all  Last night  I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother 
label1 What do you think I should do ?
label1 I don't want any more  but let's go 
label1 Wait  Hold on  I believe screw it  I'm going in is what I said to your mother last night  Don't worry  I didn't really say that  I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting 
label1 I just found out that you recommended myself  Dr  Hofstadter and Dr  Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure 
label1 I don't know what you mean by quirks  but  um  I do want to express my gratitude 
label1 Anyway  thank you 
label1 Yeah  right on  sister 
label1 Answer honestly  This is not a trial  That'll come later 
label1 Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart : Mall Cop ?
label1 I'm deleting it 
label1 No  that's the season two finale  That was quite the cliffhanger  I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts 
label1 Well  they can't cancel it  It ended on a cliffhanger 
label1 Dumplings ? Don't you understand what's going on here ?
label1 That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious  Oh  now I'll never know what happened 
label1 Oh  sure  what a wonderful idea  And after that  I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene  You know  instead of flossing  I'll rub pudding on my gums  I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for 
label1 No  They can't just cancel a show like Alphas  You know ? They have to help the viewers let go  Firefly did a movie to wrap things up  Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book  Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended 
label1 I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug 
label1 Oh  that's nonsense  I mean  you tell me stories about your day all the time  I don't care how they end 
label1 Yeah  but I just told you  I don't have a problem with closure 
label1 Oh  quite sure 
label1 I take issue with the word compulsive 
label1 Oh  Amy  And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies  Tic-tac-toe can only end in win  lose or draw  none of which will deny me closure  Especially since I'm about to win 
label1 The same way any normal person would  I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti 
label1 Or you could pitch in  grab a nostril and help me get this face off 
label1 You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated  To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release 
label1 Let's box it up 
label1 Lucky for you  ' cause I wished you were dead 
label1 Amy  I must say  I was sceptical at first  but this has truly been a transformative evening 
label1 Well  you're an excellent neuroscientist  you're a wonderful girlfriend  and '
label1 Doesn't matter  does it ?
label1 And a complete sucker 
label1 I love you  too 
label1 Hello  Uh  is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas ? Oh  smashing  Yeah  you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself  Now  down to business  Um  your show ended on a cliffhanger  Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it ? Uh-huh  Mm-hmm  I see  Well  that all stinks  No wonder you got cancelled  Bye 
label1 Leonard  you'll never guess who I just found online  Hey !
label1 Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child  I never missed an episode  He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects 
label1 Oh  dear lord  Leonard  look  He's still available for parties and events  We should hire him 
label1 Well  whatever we want  Hang out  do experiments  make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar 
label1 Well  I'm e-mailing him right now 
label1 Of course I do 
label1 It's happening  Leonard  it's happening  Professor Proton is coming to our house 
label1 And you just got yourself uninvited  See ? I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that 
label1 Yeah  that  too  Big cheque 
label1 I'm getting worried 
label1 Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV  You know  every day  four o'clock  he was there  Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas  in which case we'd join him in progress 
label1 The third floor landing  The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour  It's really you 
label1 Professor Proton  it's an honour to meet you 
label1 Leonard  you hear that ? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur  That means we're friends 
label1 Look at me  I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes 
label1 Oh  no  there are no kids  No  the  the show's for me  Come on  I'll race ya  Arthur 
label1 Yeah  that's great  Did you bring your puppet ?
label1 Oh  no  How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino ? It's nice  huh ? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay  Including the shipping !
label1 It's gonna get sucked in  It's going to get sucked in 
label1 Potato clock  Do potato clock 
label1 What  well what's wrong ? Is she upsetting you ? Because I can make her go away 
label1 Well  how can you say that ? Professor Proton's the best 
label1 Mr  Jeffries  I need to show you something  : 14:11  446
label1 Well  anyway  um  you may find this hard to believe  but I didn't have any friends growing up 
label1 But  um  I did have you  And every day at four o'clock  you'd come to my house on Channel 68  and we'd do science together  If it hadn't been for you  well  who knows what would've become of me ? You know ? Instead of a world-class physicist  I could've wound up as a hobo  Or a surgeon 
label1 Yeah  it's true  A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders 
label1 I'll do it 
label1 Oh  yeah 
label1 Met my childhood hero  now I get to ride in an ambulance  Boy  if we can get him to do that calendar  this'll be the best day ever 
label1 Soft kitty  warm kitty  little ball of fur  Happy kitty  sleepy kitty  purr  purr  purr 
label1 There anything I can get for you ? Some apple juice ? Uh  some Jell-O ?
label1 Name it 
label1 Oh  you're not  You look awful 
label1 But they'll know I'm not you  Should I call myself Professor Proton  Jr  ?
label1 Father 
label1 Dungeons & Dragons 
label1 I've got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice  Hello  new dice smell 
label1 Yeah  yeah  we'll be right there  Leonard ?
label1 I'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you 
label1 Oh  please  Every time the topic of change comes up  you throw Zachary Quinto in my face  I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut  Zachary Quinto  I'm upset that daylight saving time started  Zachary Quinto  I'm upset daylight saving time ended  Zachary Quinto  I'm saying this for the last time  Zachary Quinto was a weird  wonderful  unrepeatable event  So stop using him against me 
label1 As good ? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard  four-eyes 
label1 He does sound effects  too !
label1 Okay  well  I have a sound effect for those sound effects 
label1 It would ? Fun ? Okay  three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter  now you want the girls to play D & D ? Do you have a drug problem ?
label1 Well  I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before 
label1 I'll leave it up to the dungeon master 
label1 Yeah  we  now  Penny  we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons  It impairs our judgment 
label1 I ready my quarter-staff 
label1 Oh  even better than money  You gained experience points 
label1 That is amazing  He made me care about the ogre 
label1 Yeah  uh  wait  Doesn't he say something first ? You know  maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity ?
label1 Wait  Wait  And says ?
label1 Oh  I don't know about you guys  but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight 
label1 Another quest by Wolowitz ? Count me in 
label1 You see what happens when you let girls play D & D ?
label1 I've never knocked on my own door before  That was a wild ride 
label1 Thank you  Would you go tell everyone else that ? Because they sure think otherwise 
label1 Well  I don't think our relationship is a joke  I think ' a horse goes into a bar  bartender says  why the long face ? '  that's a joke  It's a good one  too  because a horse has a long face 
label1 Oh  my  That's an uncomfortable topic  Amy  before I met you  I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone 
label1 And now what ?
label1 I know it doesn't seem like it to you  but  for me  what we have is extremely intimate 
label1 Well  no  Hold on  My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them  We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through 
label1 I believe that  uh  we just killed a dragon  While the others pillage the corpse  I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour 
label1 What do you do ?
label1 I kiss you back on the
label1 Yeah  I used to be uncomfortable around people  but then I learned a trick  I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek 
label1 Yes  he does  He caters to my every whim 
label1 Well  now  but do you think that's a good idea ? Uh  you know Star Trek  Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition ?
label1 No one asked you  Uhura 
label1 Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid ?
label1 Great  I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety  Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats ?
label1 I'm not afraid to be alone  On land  On the sea  it would be terrifying  Because of all the drowning 
label1 Fine  no more drowning talk  I'll change the subject  Oh  Who do you think would win in a fight  you or a shark ?
label1 Very well  Things between you and Penny have never been better  I hope four months apart doesn't change anything  I should have opened with that  huh ?
label1 Leonard  you're being selfish  We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face 
label1 Oh  gee  I don't know  My schedule's a little busy 
label1 This is ridiculous  we're shopping for a party and this store doesn't even have a party section 
label1 Yeah  well  you're his girlfriend for now  You know  maybe you're not aware of this  but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches 
label1 I'm not jealous  I'm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me 
label1 It was you 
label1 Wow  No wonder you didn't get that toothpaste commercial 
label1 Um  can I have your attention  everyone ?
label1 Thank you 
label1 It did not kill me when you went to space  Monkeys went to space 
label1 Penny  we're in the red zone  The white zone is for loading and unloading  We're breaking the law 
label1 All right  you have to get out of the car right now  I'm not going to jail for you 
label1 Oh  I see a space in the white zone  Quick  circle the airport 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  a police officer's glancing in our direction  We've been made 
label1 It's just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard's face in it  He got it at the mall on clearance  Now move  move  move 
label1 Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case  and Back to the Future III was  get this  in the Back to the Future II case 
label1 So  did you do that  or am I in the house with an intruder ?
label1 You're dodging the question  I knew it was you  What was that ?
label1 This isn't a very good connection  but it sounded like someone just released a kraken 
label1 Um  well  I was worried that you might be missing Leonard  And that might be causing you to have bad dreams  like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed 
label1 To be honest  I did 
label1 Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case  Leonard did it 
label1 You're welcome  Good night 
label1 Dear Lord  you're an astronomer  Although you may have earthly woes  get your mind back on the stars  Gee  even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way 
label1 I want you to be happy  too  but not enough to do anything about it 
label1 Penny  did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains '
label1 Well  now that I've piqued your interest  welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess 
label1 You overestimate his significance in my life 
label1 Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup ? No  Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck ? I don't think so  Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code ?
label1 Well  I try 
label1 Great  I'll go first 
label1 By the way  how are you with zippers ?
label1 Well  I really need to go to the bathroom  and this one's gone all cattywampus 
label1 Ooh  Bad move 
label1 My queen can now take your rook from below 
label1 Well  if you'd like  we could call him  I mean that you could call him  As I've explained  the absence of my friends does not cause me pain  As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said  I am a rock  I am an i-i-i-island 
label1 Oh  goodie  put him on speaker phone 
label1 Are you in danger ?
label1 You were 
label1 That you're having to process your emotional pain without vodka ?
label1 Allow me to comfort you  At least you've got your health 
label1 Um  uh  in a hundred years  you'll both be dead and it won't matter ?
label1 Oh  no  I don't think that's true at all 
label1 Actually  I can't  Before Leonard left  he made me promise that I'd take care of you 
label1 Plus  if I do a good job  he said he'd bring me back a sailor's cap 
label1 Well  if it's any consolation  I'm sure Leonard's tormented every moment he's away from your warm embrace and cherry lips 
label1 Oh  seriously ?
label1 Here is a hot beverage to comfort you  It's in a to-go cup  Make of that what you will 
label1 Well  I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess 
label1 All right  In 4D chess '
label1 But I don't want to know how many underpants you own  Although  based on the floor of your bedroom  I'd say it's a thousand 
label1 I've seen that  Yeah  Serial Apeist  Howard found it online the day we met you 
label1 And it was literally the moment you walked out the door  But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for  Okay  here's one I thought I'd take to the grave 
label1 Hmm  A while back  YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system  I tell people I'm okay with it  but I'm really not 
label1 Yes  Whew  I feel ten pounds lighter 
label1 Here's something else you don't know about me  You just hurt my feelings 
label1 It is to me ; that's the point 
label1 Your apology is accepted 
label1 How about a hearty handshake ?
label1 Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla 
label1 And here's another interesting weather fact 
label1 Joke if you must  but you're going to miss these moments  With Leonard home in a few days  this was your last time driving me to the grocery store 
label1 Uh  Stuart  I was wondering if you could help me find something 
label1 I'm a real collector  How rare is it ?
label1 Don't try and trick me into buying something I don't want  Now let's talk Aquaman 
label1 Twelve hundred dollars  That's my final offer 
label1 Oh  right  a present for Leonard  You better throw in that squirt gun 
label1 Oh  Penny  I see you've ordered pizza  I have Chinese food 
label1 Are you sure ? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles  we could play Marco Polo  I mean  of course  a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer  not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport 
label1 Oh  I can take a look at it 
label1 I'm quite familiar with plumbing  Not to brag  but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet 
label1 That's curious  If there's no one here  why are there two glasses of wine on the table ?
label1 Of course  Ask a silly question 
label1 That's odd 
label1 What's odd is they're in the trash can 
label1 Oh  very well  I'm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude  Oh !
label1 Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet ?
label1 Oh  great  Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun ?
label1 Uh  elephant ?
label1 I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard 
label1 Oh  really ? She and I once had a staring contest  She clapped really loud and made me blink  It's a small leap from there to sexual infidelity 
label1 Amy  there were Chinese food containers in the trash can 
label1 No  it's you  All right  I hear whispering and giggling  Now I think I hear kissing 
label1 There's kissing in Star Trek  smarty-pants 
label1 Please  Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy ? Yeah  that's it  I'm catching her in the act 
label1 Leonard ?
label1 Oh  no  I should apologize  Uh  I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you 
label1 Oh  no  no  let's not sugarcoat this  You find me finicky  pedantic and annoying 
label1 Fine  Leonard  there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore 
label1 No  no  you save your apologies for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny 
label1 You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir ?
label1 Excuse me  This changes nothing  Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year  Amy  you're going to be Olive Oyl  Lay off the doughnuts 
label1 I'd like a ride  Assuming you actually do take me to work 
label1 Who knows ? Uh  you said you'd be home yesterday  but you came home three days ago  You say you're taking me to work  but for all I know  I'll end up in a deserted amusement park  Or a cornfield maze  Or a back alley dog fight  You tell me 
label1 Okay  By the way  you have something on your shirt 
label1 Hurts  doesn't it ? You know  I find myself wondering if anything you've ever told me is true 
label1 You say you're from New Jersey  but how can I believe you ?
label1 I want you to admit that what you did was wrong 
label1 I wish I could believe you 
label1 You say one thing and do the other  so then you are driving me and you find me a delight 
label1 Keep it up ?
label1 Thought I heard you out here 
label1 You don't get a hey  You get a hmm 
label1 You're right  Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating 
label1 Careful  Amy  The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy 
label1 Yes  You're either with me or against me 
label1 Maybe there's a third option 
label1 Howard  Raj  Judas 
label1 A crazy person with a long memory  and if all goes according to plan  a robot army 
label1 Or a mutant army  It depends on how my Kickstarter goes 
label1 And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist  and then to cap off the perfect day  the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures 
label1 Think of me when you apply it 
label1 I don't think thatqualifies as a mystery  we all knew what we were doing 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Come on 
label1 That's amusing  I was going to say that about M  I  T   but it works for Princeton  too 
label1 I'm sorry  Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party ?
label1 Well  if he does  do you know how filthy those rental balls are ? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams 
label1 No  Oh  it actually is if you get the joke  It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school 
label1 Oh  see ? Now he gets it 
label1 Really ? The only time I'm ever picked first for a team and I'm stuck with the liability ?
label1 Yes  and do you know what the odds are I'd pick your name ?
label1 But we haven't finished the puzzle 
label1 You think you know the answer  But it could be a trick  What if when the puzzle's complete  there's a sign in the window that says go to the train store ?
label1 Well  I hope you're wrong  I really want to go to the train store 
label1 It's the comic book store 
label1 It is a marathon  not a sprint 
label1 Got it 
label1 I thought we were the Lightning Sharks 
label1 The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks 
label1 Oh  simple  the ' arrah  ' arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah  a member of the Legion of Superheroes  known as Element Lad  And then the word He  it wasn't the masculine pronoun  but rather H e  the abbreviation for helium  See where I'm going with this ?
label1 And I'm sure your parents are proud  Now  finally  the line in this room the thing you'll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing  who's made entirely of '
label1 Those are map coordinates  Got ' em  Let's go 
label1 No one likes a know-it-all  Penny 
label1 Okay  another 30 feet 
label1 Yes  Yes  My brain is better than everybody's 
label1 Because you've been training for this your whole life  You live in a pile of dirty laundry 
label1 I'm not a child  I know the word ninny 
label1 Hey  that's my shirt 
label1 Oh  that's clever 
label1 Be there in a minute  I just have to pre-soak these 
label1 That's it ? Good '
label1 Story problem ? You  oh  Amy  what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are  Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas  two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation  I've watched it 36 times  except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene  which I can only watch when it's still light out  but  I defy you to find a story problem  Here's my jaw  drop it 
label1 Oh  I see your confusion  You don't understand  Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip 
label1 I'll tell you why  Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me  so now I'm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that 
label1 Yeah  except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story  With or without him  the Nazis find the ark  open it and die 
label1 Oh  it turns out Amy's beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece  He's got too much pride  she's got too much prejudice  it just works 
label1 Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke 
label1 And I think I've got it  Consider  a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined  he causes nothing but problems  Why do they keep him ?
label1 Of course  You know  why couldn't she just like Ziggy ? Yeah ? That thing's riddled with plot holes 
label1 Ooh  I think she's a fan of Garfield as well  Oh  darn it  now so am I 
label1 Wait  hang on  You've spent time with Amy  Can you think of anything she's fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed ?
label1 Yes  Why ?
label1 April 13  a dark night  indeed 
label1 I'm calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening 
label1 Yes  You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me  So I'd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series  Little House on the Prairie 
label1 Um  I'm putting on lotion  Are you in or not ?
label1 Excellent  Then I shall see you tomorrow  Good night  Dr  Fowler 
label1 Good night  indeed  What a rube  Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands ?
label1 Well  you sit back  relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory  You see that cabin there ? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land  Yeah  Personally  I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong  but this is your favourite show  not mine  Oh  look at little Laura Ingalls  eating that peanut butter sandwich  Peanut butter ? Huh ? That's strange  since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s  If I knew this show was about time travel  I would have watched it much sooner 
label1 That's silly  Almost as silly as Dr  Baker having a telephone  since telephones only existed in large cities at that time  This is more like Little House on the Preposterous 
label1 Fine  I'm mad at you  Not only did you ruin Raiders for me  you may have ruined the whole franchise  Except for the fourth one  which was bad before you got your mitts on it 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Yes  But not as good as I'm going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays  He's a cat  He doesn't have a job 
label1 That's true  He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing 
label1 Oh  no  I got bored with that  I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon 
label1 If you do that  I'll scream 
label1 That makes two of us  My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days  Come on  one 
label1 You know  riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately  The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game  And he's terrible at it  I always win 
label1 Well  why wouldn't I be ?
label1 My father used to say that all the time  That and  um  who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here ? But what does that have to do with you working at the university ?
label1 Really ?
label1 Huh  Yeah  I always took it literally  That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant  Hmm 
label1 Not as relieved as I'm about to be  It's a brave new world  little lady 
label1 Why not ? Hairy Fairy 
label1 That's a Raging Ogre 
label1 Why ? So you can see the look on Amy's face when she hears my top-notch idea ?
label1 Hi  Um  I've reconsidered  Uh  you can't work where I work  Enjoy the rest of your evening 
label1 Mmm  you are not going to come out of this looking good 
label1 Well  I was  But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other 
label1 Now  don't be insulted  He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious 
label1 Yeah  well  now  well  keep it short  From what I gather  brevity is your friend  So  are we good here ?
label1 Last week  you told Leonard he couldn't wear his Wookie jacket out in public 
label1 Hmm  You sure your mothlike personality won't be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself ?
label1 Well  then  you have my permission 
label1 Too late  No backsies 
label1 Yeah  but to be fair  he only said the part about him getting sick of you 
label1 If it makes you feel any better  Amy and I are fine  I mean  really good 
label1 Uh  it also wouldn't have happened if  in the early universe  hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common  This is fun  Your turn 
label1 Oh  we're fine  As Howard advised  she's merely respecting our professional boundaries 
label1 Yeah  you make a good point  It would appear I was worried for nothing  Look at her  desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table  Don't worry  little moth  The flame will come to you 
label1 Oh  please  I'm your boyfriend  You call me Sheldon  That's right  I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool 
label1 Dr  Fowler ?
label1 Well  I'm done with work  so ugh !
label1 Oh  baguettes  Yes  I like baguettes  What exactly are you doing ?
label1 So  goofing off  As I was saying  I'm done with work and Leonard's not  So good news  you get to take me home  Play your cards right  I'll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night 
label1 What on earth are you talking about ? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful  Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour 
label1 Aw  Embarrassed you ?
label1 I'm starting to get the sense that you're angry with me 
label1 Couple things  actually  Your tone of voice  your body language '
label1 Well  now  that 
label1 Bleugh !
label1 Oh  I had to take the bus home  Fell asleep and missed my stop 
label1 Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka ?
label1 Well  I do now  They're a lovely people  Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them  If you're hungry  I brought home some mutton and coconut milk 
label1 I was asking for directions  Apparently  there was a communication problem 
label1 Yeah  I thought so  too  but she's acting very strangely  I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus  and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow  Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law's witch doctor practice 
label1 Well  can you believe she said I embarrassed her ?
label1 But you don't even know '
label1 But  now  but in my defence '
label1 I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us  Also  I had one heck of a bus nap  Oh  speaking of which  do you want some mutton and coconut milk ?
label1 Well  I cannot give this stuff away 
label1 My point is  we're a couple  and I like you for who you are  quirks and all 
label1 Can't talk  In the zone 
label1 Can't listen  zone  Also don't care 
label1 Really don't care 
label1 When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory ?
label1 Ooh  somebody call the burn ward  And back to the zone 
label1 Leonard  prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius 
label1 Look at it  I feel like my mind just made a baby  And it's beautiful  It's not like human babies  which are loud and covered in goop 
label1 Gentlemen  Uh  no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough  Now  if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria  please refrain  I don't care for heights  motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks 
label1 Oh  well  thank you  Believe it or not  I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron  and the results were extremely promising 
label1 Yeah  I know  They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party  Although I'm pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that  I like China  See  they know how to keep people in line 
label1 Oh  more testing  more success  more fame  Yeah  but don't worry  I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I've always been 
label1 Now give me that cookie  I discovered an element 
label1 Let's see  what's next ? Okay  here  This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery 
label1 And that's why you're not on a list for my tree fort  Ooh  guess who's getting an article written about him in Physics Today ? I'll give you a hint  You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday 
label1 Well  you should be  My discovery is spreading like wildfire  Unlike my mole  which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean 
label1 This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and '
label1 No  No  no  no  no 
label1 I've made a horrible mistake 
label1 What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder  I'm not a genius  I'm a fraud 
label1 There's nothing happy about it  I'm being given credit that I don't deserve 
label1 No  Leonard  this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life  Every science classroom  every periodic table  every textbook  this mistake will be staring back at me  Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows  I've got to find a way to stop this thing 
label1 You know  frankly  I'd prefer a sex tape 
label1 Stop it  Stop celebrating me 
label1 And no woos  Oh  not you  Dr  Woo  You're fine  I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me  My so-called breakthrough wasn't the result of my genius  It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake  So please refrain from praising me for it in the future 
label1 Oh  no  they found the element 
label1 I know  When will this nightmare end ?
label1 You're not ?
label1 Congratulations  Dr  Fowler  You just made the fort 
label1 I hate to pile on the bad news  but I just got a raise 
label1 She might be contagious  Don't you think I'm having a rough enough day ?
label1 Is it me  or does she not look so good ?
label1 She's sick  I knew it  Bye 
label1 You distract me  I've been distracted since the moment I met you 
label1 Well  you should be  Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you  And not just on the cheek  but on the mouth  Like mommies and daddies do 
label1 Look  A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine  Wow  I can't wait until I get a rash 
label1 Hey  isn't that Professor Proton ?
label1 Arthur ? Arthur  it's me  Sheldon Cooper  You may not remember because of your advanced age 
label1 This is my girlfriend  Amy  Amy  this is television legend Arthur Jeffries  His science show inspired millions of children 
label1 So  what prescription are you getting filled ?
label1 No  no  no  I'm really good at this  All right  give me a hint  Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything ?
label1 But I'm hanging out with my friend  and we're having fun  Look how happy he is 
label1 Goody  What's it say ?
label1 That's strange  That he would come to you for that and not me  Oh  I got two emails from him  Do you have Leonard's email address ? And  Never mind  I found it  I can't believe he picked you over me 
label1 Sheldon Cooper does not cry 
label1 And to think I idolized that man  And why ? At the end of the day he's just another Hollywood phony 
label1 Yeah  they say don't meet your heroes  Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity  because if you do  you'll see them as they really are  degenerate carnival folk 
label1 That's even worse  Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him  Pervert 
label1 Yes  I have  And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills 
label1 That's kind of a stretch  Look  when it comes to social skills  I've mastered the big three  There's the coy smile  There's the friendly chuckle  There's the vocalization of sympathy  Aw  That last one's tricky  I'm still working on it 
label1 No  go ahead  say it  I know what it is  I've heard it my whole life  The word's annoying  Go ahead  say it  Say it  Say I'm annoying 
label1 Oh  it won't hurt my feelings  Go ahead  Amy  say I'm annoying  I'm annoying  I'm annoying  I'm annoying  Yeah  now  uh  now where are you going ? Look  you know you want to say it  say it  Say I'm annoying  Go ahead  say it  Say it  Say it  Amy  say it  Well  she can't stand it when I'm right 
label1 Anyway  I wanted to apologize  I am truly sorry 
label1 No  no  now that we've cleared the air  I wanted to discuss another matter with you 
label1 Well  then  I'll make this quick  Um  I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard  Now  I know he said it's promising and he's going to collaborate on it  but now that you and I are friends again  I am at your disposal  And  um  frankly  lending my name and reputation to it will help  because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been  Or dead 
label1 So  uh  what do you say ?
label1 It's because I'm annoying  right ? I know it is  Say it  Say it  Say I'm annoying 
label1 Say it  Arthur  say it  Say I'm annoying  Say it  Say it  I'm annoying  Say it 
label1 Well  that really hurt 
label1 Hello  Leonard  Oh  hello  Arthur  What an odd coincidence that you're both here 
label1 Because as it just so happens  I'm also spending the day with a beloved children's television science personality  Isn't that right  new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy  Sorry  I replaced you with a newer model 
label1 No  I said you were teaching someone a lesson  Now let's go 
label1 Arthur ?
label1 I'll get Leonard 
label1 Thank you  It would be an honour 
label1 Actually  I don't need that  I hacked into your e-mail account and read it 
label1 Well  first  I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing 
label1 Second  um  I thought your paper was inspired 
label1 Can I invite you in for tea ?
label1 Yeah  and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket  You said  plop  plop  fizz  fizz  oh  what a blast-off it is  Remember ? Remember that ? Remember ?
label1 Oh  wait here  I'll get some Alka-Seltzer  we can build that rocket  and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house  As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it 
label1 Leonard  where are the Skee-Ball tickets ?
label1 None of your business  But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later  you are most welcome to sniff it 
label1 Oh  thank you  Here  get yourself an eraser for your troubles 
label1 I seem to be a few tickets short  Are there more in the box ?
label1 Well  you barely looked  Let me see 
label1 Leonard  let me look in the box 
label1 That seems like a reasonable request  Although so did  hey  Leonard  would you mind returning that DVD ?
label1 I said I would 
label1 You wouldn't make jokes if you could feel the way I feel 
label1 How about this ? I promise I won't pester you about the DVD  You can defecate in peace  That's a win for both of us  But  until this matter is resolved  I would like you to wear this sweater  With nothing underneath it 
label1 Put it on  Let's share the experience 
label1 Oh  did I forget to tell you ? That store went out of business years ago 
label1 How those nipples feeling  chief ?
label1 Gentlemen  please  Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes  He can't walk in my actual shoes  He has the feet of a toddler 
label1 I'm thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy 
label1 Yeah  It's great you're here  I'd love to get an engineer's opinion 
label1 This chair is squeaky  Now  do I fix it or get a new one ?
label1 Hey  that next of kin thing sounds pretty good 
label1 I don't know why that surprises you  I'm a grown man  As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel 
label1 The more interesting question you should be asking is  what does this flower smell like ?
label1 There's nothing to tell  Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don't Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions  one of which was stop and smell the flowers 
label1 Please  Ha-ha  Oh 
label1 How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower ?
label1 There's probably a deep reason  Which I'd be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can 
label1 Oh  not necessarily  I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon 
label1 You know  it might be fun  You love hummus 
label1 Leonard  I have something to tell you  but I want you to promise not to flip out 
label1 Seven years ago  I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it 
label1 I know  And it wasn't easy  Do you have any idea what it's like to wait for years and never know if you're going to finally get satisfaction ?
label1 Yeah  uh  look  it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow  Even you  with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders  you couldn't do it 
label1 Mmm  You know  I've been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse  so I'd love to go  but  unfortunately  that sounds awful 
label1 Oh  since you put it that way  I'd love to go  but that sounds even more awful 
label1 Uh  excuse me  but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it  Do our traditions mean nothing to you ?
label1 Ugh  fine  I'll go  But if her food is delicious  Thanksgiving is ruined  and it's on you 
label1 Do we really have to go to Mrs  Wolowitz's house ?
label1 Now I know how the African slaves felt  Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man 
label1 He's right 
label1 Let me ask you a question  At any point  was Las Vegas on its side ?
label1 Yes  Miss Amy 
label1 Oh  oh  oh  I have a reason  It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack  but every time Leonard's proposed  he's gotten a resounding no  Yeah  that's just off the top of my head 
label1 Hah ! Penny ? Next 
label1 It smells wonderful  Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen ? Because I  too  know '
label1 They passed against a nickel defence  They should have run it off-tackle 
label1 My father loved football  He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework 
label1 I would throw a quick slant to a wideout  given that the defence is showing blitz 
label1 I don't care for your mother's bathroom  There's not an angle to do one's business without a clown figurine staring at you 
label1 1993  Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious  Then I finally got to do my calculus 
label1 So was the man who owned the local liquor store  He cried and cried 
label1 No  sir  He did try to give me one for my high school graduation  but I was 11 and my mom said no 
label1 All right 
label1 Do you mind ? We're having a moment here 
label1 All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car  And there's the clown that came out of her  I really didn't want to come here  but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time 
label1 She's so tiny  It's funny when she's mad 
label1 Perhaps you're right  I'm sorry for my behaviour  I've had alcohol  and it's caused me to be inappropriate 
label1 Ain't she great ?
label1 This is a Jewish house  I don't think they have pigskin 
label1 I just vomited on a lot of clowns 
label1 Thank you  Uh  the university made me come here  I didn't want to  Uh  big fan of the show 
label1 Who ? Give me their names  I bet it's Wolowitz 
label1 Can we talk about something else ? Do you know that I yodel ?
label1 Yes  yes  I'd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry  Everyone laugh at the circus freak  You know  I don't need to sit here and take this  Flatow  It is because of bullies like you  every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television 
label1 President Seibert  I don't know why you're yelling  You're the one who made me go on the radio  I was expecting a professional science interview  not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock  Well  if the university needs money so badly  perhaps you should start a swear jar  Whoa  that one's worth a dollar 
label1 Yeah  well  I'm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins 
label1 Look  you're gonna be doing this stuff for a while  You're just gonna have to find a way to get used to it 
label1 But none of you know what this is like  Being celebrated for something you wish you never did 
label1 Here comes the Embarrassment Express  With stops at Fraudville  Wonder Blunderberg  and Kansas City  Because it's a hub 
label1 Do you have cookies ?
label1 Good  I don't deserve cookies  Come in  Wil ?
label1 Why are you here ?
label1 Certainly  Although  right now  I'm having a rough time because there's three people in my room  and it's starting to feel like a discotheque 
label1 Oh  nonsense  Wil  Your endless tweets are not that bad 
label1 How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher ? You were wonderful  A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory  Who couldn't relate to that ?
label1 That just happened to me  Next time you're stuck for a tweet  feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is 
label1 I do see what you're saying  That helps 
label1 Would you two like to stay and play trains with me ?
label1 Oh  great  now  I work the controls  I say all aboard  You sit quietly and watch 
label1 You should probably go 
label1 Hello  President Siebert  Thank you for taking my call  I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery  Oh  no  no  no  no  No need to thank mNo  thank my friend  Wil Wheaton  For your information  I have nine friends  hmm ? Ten if we include you  Nine it is  Ah  it's ten  I'll count Wolowitz  Hello  friend Leonard 
label1 I'm in a great mood 
label1 Yeah  but what about the Chinese research team ? They found it 
label1 I can't believe it 
label1 You robbed me of my greatest achievement 
label1 I'm back down to nine friends  Make it eight  I'm sick of Wolowitz  too 
label1 By taking away my only claim to fame ? Well  if you wanted to make me happy  you could have told me a joke  Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends 
label1 That's what makes their friendship unlikely 
label1 Leonard disproved my element  Now all the attention is going to go away 
label1 When I thought the element was real  I didn't want it  But now that Leonard made it not exist  I want it more than anything in the world 
label1 Don't you dare use science against me  Science is my best friend  Oh  good  I'm back up to eight 
label1 Oh  yes  nine  Welcome back  buddy 
label1 I have no idea what she's talking about  but we're ganging up on you so I agree 
label1 No  no  of course you have to publish  That's your responsibility as a scientist  Doing otherwise would be unethical  You have no choice 
label1 Not to me  The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas  But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit 
label1 What's that animal doing in our apartment ?
label1 I have two words for you  Jurassic Park  This day just keeps getting worse and worse 
label1 It probably won't 
label1 Oh  everything is just sex with you isn't it ?
label1 Thank you  Ira  if I may  I'd like to apologize for my behaviour last week 
label1 Now  isn't there something you'd like to say to me ?
label1 You're telling it wrong  Ira  to really understand the story here  you have to start at the very beginning  A small town in East Texas  where a young genius named '
label1 That's right  Sheldon Cooper  He was bitten by his neighbour's dog  leading to his first scientific breakthrough  the doggie death-ray  Which  sadly  he couldn't build because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium 
label1 What a surprise  Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me ?
label1 You know  I don't just say smart things about science  I also yodel 
label1 Oh  I would  but I'm on my way out 
label1 Yes  My sister's uterus came down with a baby 
label1 No  I will be Uncle Dr  Cooper 
label1 Well  I never told you about my brother's kidney stone  You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals ?
label1 Yes  I'm filling in for her husband who's recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident  Lucky duck 
label1 Oh  no  thank you  I don't want to be an inconvenience  Chop-chop  Leonard  We leave in ten minutes 
label1 The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me ?
label1 That's so thoughtful  You guys are the best 
label1 <i> She went into labor an hour ago 
label1 No  she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn't available 
label1 And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ' n Slide 
label1 Oh  boy  I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt 
label1 No  it's not  I've seen things  Lady things 
label1 Did you hear that ? A mop  I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the janitor of my sister's birth canal 
label1 A tad asymmetrical  but nothing to be concerned about 
label1 To what ?
label1 I'm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt 
label1 Penny  for the thousandth time  I'm saving myself for someone special  Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud 
label1 Actually  much better 
label1 I don't know  I just got back 
label1 My mother asked me to get some towels  I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed  Bath & Beyond 
label1 That's it  The baby's here  It's a boy 
label1 Oh no  no  I'm not going back in there  That baby is so irritating  He has literally been crying his entire life 
label1 Ugh  all right  I'll go  But from what I've seen  his attention span is as limited as his bladder control 
label1 Me  too  I got a lot of TV to catch up on 
label1 To quote Han Solo  I know 
label1 Looking into the blank  innocent eyes of a creature that couldn't begin to comprehend anything I was saying ? Basically just another day at the office 
label1 We can  but thanks to Steve Jobs  we don't have to 
label1 Yay  Penny 
label1 Why is that funny ? That's just unhygienic 
label1 I don't think so  I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist  For example  uh  Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet  or exercise  or both  See ? The twist is that people don't usually change  Well  they don't 
label1 Wait  if Howard's mother is coming  then you should also steal marbles  Because she's obese  and hippos are obese  and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos  they eat marbles  Maybe I need to dumb these down for you 
label1 Leonard  do you think I'm funny ?
label1 The philosopher Henri Bergson says it's funny when a human being behaves like an object 
label1 Oh  he didn't perform stand-up comedy  he was a philosopher 
label1 Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy  which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time  Unless they're German  ' cause that's a tough crowd 
label1 I don't get it 
label1 I don't know about you  but I'm very uncomfortable with all this 
label1 I've never seen this show before and now I'm starting with episode 246 ? It's unnatural 
label1 All right 
label1 Well  don't ask me  Until I see the prequel  I'm lost 
label1 This is interesting  Apparently  a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise 
label1 BRAIN LESIONS !
label1 Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex 
label1 Excellent 
label1 Kumquat ?
label1 Ointment ?
label1 Now  would you say ointment is more  equal to  or less funny than kumquat ?
label1 All of them 
label1 Who's in the mood to laugh ?
label1 But I used science to construct the perfect joke 
label1 So  a sandwich  a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar  Where are you going ?
label1 Should I follow you ?
label1 I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous 
label1 Can't sleep ?
label1 Why not ?
label1 Does that mean the relationship is over ?
label1 Why don't you ask her ?
label1 No  That wouldn't be funny at all 
label1 It's an outrage 
label1 The university  they think they can do whatever they want  We just have to sit there and take it 
label1 You work tirelessly for someone  and this is what you get 
label1 Oh  this again ? So  Penny proposed  you didn't say yes  and now you think you may have lost her love forever  How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days ?
label1 I'm going to go inside  put on my coziest pajamas  curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over 
label1 Come on  take me to work with you 
label1 Please  What if there's a big breakthrough in science today and I'm not there to see it ?
label1 No  I was just tricking you 
label1 Leonard  wait  Take me with you 
label1 Too bad  I'm coming with you 
label1 I'm on vacation  What do you think ?
label1 Leonard told me to stay 
label1 Where are you going ?
label1 Well  have fun 
label1 Really ?
label1 Okay  I'm inside the CERN super collider 
label1 Let me guess 
label1 What was I gonna do ? Two ins in a row ? Where's my lemonade ?
label1 A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress  to forget my order one last time 
label1 Do you see me drinking lemonade ?
label1 Why do you ask ?
label1 The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100 % of your time and energy to it  When I decided I was going to be a physicist  I didn't take some other job in case it didn't work out  Which wasn't easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms  Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year 
label1 Because he's not like us  Penny  We're dreamers 
label1 I've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals 
label1 Too bad  It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze 
label1 Namaste 
label1 I'm willing to if you guys are 
label1 Y  No  I'm as much a part of this relationship as you two  and I think it's high time we put all our cards on the table  For example  where is this going ? Are you two ever getting married ? And  if so  where will we all live ? Have you thought about that ?
label1 Penny ?
label1 Good  Now we're getting somewhere 
label1 Yeah  no kidding  Despite what it says on her r'sum '  she is no longer 22 
label1 I'm fine with it 
label1 Well  to celebrate this reconciliation  let's all share a milk shake  Uh  Penny  you'll need a straw 
label1 Don't get soft on me  Hofstadter  I will slap those glasses right off your face 
label1 Good Lord  this is not the time for flirting  keep it in your pants 
label1 Every year  I told you  wear a diaper 
label1 It's live  Go  go  go  go  go 
label1 Do not stop refreshing your screens 
label1 Yay ! And they say firefighters are the real heroes 
label1 Oh  Sunday's the worst  Everybody's leaving  most of the good panels are over  and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL 
label1 Not Sunday  I love Sunday 
label1 It's okay  You know  there  there's always WonderCon in Anaheim  you know ? That  that's just as good  Excuse me 
label1 Gentlemen  I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem  We don't need them  I'm starting my own convention 
label1 I told you  Buying scalped tickets is against the rules  If you get caught  you get banned from Comic-Con for life  Life  Leonard  You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old  and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days 
label1 You know  there was a time when Comic-Con didn't exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen  And you mark my words  I'm gonna rip that guy off 
label1 I didn't even get to that part 
label1 Not true  Wil thinks this is a great idea  He was just concerned that he wasn't a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event  Also  that's the same day that he shampoos his beard 
label1 You don't know that  I still have plenty of solid leads on this list 
label1 Gentlemen  I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention 
label1 I don't think that will be necessary for Mr  James Earl Jones  You heard me  The voice of Darth Vader  the Lion King's dad  and FYI  the guy who says  This is CNN  Which also sounds like Darth Vader 
label1 Simple  Earlier today  he tweeted that he's looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner  I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant  That's where he'll be  and that's where I'm going  and '
label1 You're the ones who are going to get in trouble  You're buying non-transferable tickets  And from a stranger  no less  Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con  if caught  you could be charged with petty theft  You think about that while I'm warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter  He got lucky this time  There are some weirdoes out there 
label1 Thank you  My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating  you'd think I was a creepy stalker 
label1 He is  Mr  Earl Jones  he is 
label1 Me  too  But he wasn't  was he ?
label1 So messed up 
label1 Is it true  as a child  you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years ?
label1 Oh  Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor ?
label1 Oh  James  I could listen to your stories all night 
label1 In the jungle  the mighty jungle  the lion sleeps tonight '
label1 Bring it home  Mufasa  Eee  eee  eee  eee  eee  um  um-a-weh 
label1 Whose house is this ?
label1 Oh  How much does it cost to get them off my lap ?
label1 Oh  right  Well  my friends and I couldn't get into Comic-Con this year  and I was trying to start my own convention  and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist 
label1 Really ?
label1 Ay-yi-yi 
label1 I'm sorry  who's Angie Dickinson ?
label1 I submitted you a notarised list 
label1 Well  you don't like Princess Corncob  you don't like Fester  you're just impossible to please 
label1 Ah  the worst for last  Hmm  Classic Flakey 
label1 I hate every word in that sentence  Including in  at  we and a 
label1 For starters  a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table 
label1 Oh  very well  What are the sleeping arrangements ? We've only been dating for three years  If we were to share a room  people might talk 
label1 What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub ?
label1 Look  I appreciate the effort  but I'm still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me 
label1 Wow  I'm feeling the urge to hug you  And one  and two  all right  Gollum  we're good 
label1 Howard  which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train ?
label1 Oh  I'm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch  it will be embarrassing 
label1 Oh  my  Well  then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot 
label1 It's magnificent  This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever 
label1 I'm prepared to say I love it  as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard 
label1 Uh  I do  Uh  does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform ?
label1 Get out of town 
label1 How many trains have you been on ?
label1 Wow  Your life's amazing 
label1 You're right  That was insensitive of me  I have to go back to my table now  You should join us 
label1 Trick question  There never was one 
label1 In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four ?
label1 I never want this day to end 
label1 Come on 
label1 The conductor and I have the same pocket watch 
label1 Dare I say loco ? Oh  and  Amy  guess what ? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work  he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us 
label1 Excuse me  I think you're being a little rude 
label1 How is that possible ? I've hardly spoken to you since we got on the train 
label1 I get it 
label1 Oh  really ? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy  Did you mean that  or were you just trying to trick me ?
label1 Good  Um  the conductor said if I come back to the engine room  he'd show me how to bring the train through a crossing 
label1 It was wonderful 
label1 I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do  uh  I kissed Amy on the lips  and  uh  the conductor played his banjo for me  Good night 
label1 Oh  well  my new friend's name was Eric  Um  Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert  Oh  and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger  but he made up for it with his can-do attitude 
label1 Hmm  It never occurred to me to pick a favourite 
label1 I can't answer that without collecting additional data 
label1 I'm not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog  but all right 
label1 Yeah  she's right  You're grown men  the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches 
label1 You'll get ' em next time 
label1 No one is running anywhere  We're not getting a dining room table 
label1 Do you want the long answer or the short answer ?
label1 Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system  if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear  a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result 
label1 You know  I'd love to  but  um  I'm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98 
label1 I can't talk right now  I have several thousand updates to install 
label1 It's a made-up story  Leonard  I don't even know why you're talking about it 
label1 You  how can you say that ? You show me one thing in here we can live without 
label1 Well  that means not one  or not any  Maybe instead of a table  you should buy a dictionary  Well  I don't know if I won that  but at least he's upset 
label1 My spot on the couch has a great view of a window  Sometimes I can see space battles through it  It's called a TV 
label1 You're absolutely right  Nope 
label1 So  when can we get rid of it ?
label1 I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will  and then you came along and reshaped him  with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals 
label1 That's not true 
label1 She told you ?
label1 You're right  Without realizing it  I've allowed that woman to alter my personality 
label1 No  No  I've changed  Like the frog who's put in a pot of water that's heated so gradually he doesn't realize he's boiling to death 
label1 No  You've opened my eyes to the truth  Amy has made me a more affectionate  open-minded person  And that stops now 
label1 At the bottom  I must say  I'm relieved you're not making more of a scene out of this 
label1 It doesn't ?
label1 Wait  wait  now  hang on  You think he manipulates me ?
label1 It is hideous 
label1 Wait  How do I know that you're not manipulating me right now ?
label1 How do I know you're not saying that as part of the manipulation ?
label1 No  Sorry to disappoint you  but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me 
label1 Yeah  okay  you can stop trying to make this about our relationship 
label1 Which is stronger than ever  This is about you trying to change my environment  which was perfect the way it was 
label1 I don't need to explain myself to you !
label1 Keep the table  We don't use that space 
label1 No  thanks  We're fine  I mean  if you people want to eat at the table  then that's what you should do  I like eating down here because this is how we've always done things  But if those days are gone  they're gone  It just makes me sad 
label1 How about Penny's depressing acting career ?
label1 She does  42 minutes in 
label1 I have an eidetic memory  I don't know what his problem is 
label1 Am I missing something  or isn't that the part she was born to play ?
label1 Are you sure ? We were making fun of failed careers  We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's 
label1 Yes  and Hawkeye's in the Avengers  but no one ever says help  Hawkeye 
label1 Well  with that sorted out  I'm happy to answer your question  Bernadette  Howard started it 
label1 I wasn't referring to this evening  Ten years ago  upon first seeing me  your husband claimed that I looked like C - 3PO and Pee-wee Herman  And he called me C - 3P - wee Herman 
label1 In any event  that began a decade-long progression of insults  pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions  To this day  I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny  Which  other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page  is complete filth 
label1 Very well  How do you propose we move forward ?
label1 That's a great idea  And in the spirit of our new arrangement  I will mask my surprise that you came up with it 
label1 I have one question  Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America ?
label1 I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming 
label1 Oh  I'm fine  It's just some  uh  stomach medication for my trip  There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America 
label1 Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on ?
label1 Maybe it's just something minor  Ooh  good news  the light just went out 
label1 Oh  in that case  I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard 
label1 It is  You were wrong  friend Howard  She completely understood 
label1 Oh  who's the real astronaut ?
label1 Oh  Yay 
label1 I have to go to the bathroom 
label1 But I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe  Despite all my e-mails  the toilet didn't have a seatbelt 
label1 Why are you getting annoyed ?
label1 Like when ?
label1 Well  truth be told  as a child  I did dream of going to space  Those astronauts were my heroes  And when you got to go  it was hard for me 
label1 But I still need to use the bathroom 
label1 No  turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere  I'm not scared at all  Oh  apple juice  stay where you are 
label1 I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you 
label1 Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled  But not as big 
label1 In a minute 
label1 Thank you for my bobble head 
label1 It wasn't easy  Was it Buzz ?
label1 I already am  I'm bringing the gift of knowledge 
label1 Despite what her Bible says  recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament  they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later 
label1 Yes  but now that I've seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like  there's no going back  Boy  I can't wait to see the look on her face  We're leaving right now 
label1 Nothing 
label1 I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again 
label1 I'm not nearly drunk enough  Okay  Do you have any idea what it's like to see your mother ravaging someone ?
label1 No  I wanted to surprise her  What am I supposed to say to her after something like this ?
label1 I have to  How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don't tell her how disappointed I am  and that I'll never forgive her ?
label1 Yeah  maybe you better  I took a pretty big sip 
label1 Okay  let's do this 
label1 You  aren't you gonna come with me ?
label1 Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on ?
label1 Who was he ?
label1 How long have you been involved with him ?
label1 And of those few months  how long have you been a demented sex pervert ?
label1 Perhaps not  But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life  and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas 
label1 Or what ?
label1 But I'm a professional scientist 
label1 I'm a grown man 
label1 Apparently any man is welcome in this house  Why not you ? I thought you were waiting in the car 
label1 No  I'm not sure how we're going to get past this 
label1 Howard  we've all seen your mother naked  That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe 
label1 I didn't know she did 
label1 What did you do ?
label1 I'm sorry  Although  based on your story  you absolutely were the reason why 
label1 You may have a point  I love my mother  Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel 
label1 I think what most upsets me about it  Mother  is the hypocrisy  Doesn't this contradict all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life ?
label1 Then why are you doing it ?
label1 Well  this is confusing for me  But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness  So  I'll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance 
label1 Mother  if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion  then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman  You know  it's not all sock hops  soda jerks and segregation anymore 
label1 My point is that you're going to need to be careful  You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology  but now you're going to need a stronger friend named latex 
label1 Well  someone has to 
label1 No  don't look to Him  He's mad at you right now 
label1 Boy  do I have to urinate 
label1 Seriously  I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis 
label1 Because I'm trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4  Oh  pee  why'd I say that ?
label1 I'm not being stupid  I'm employing the work of Dutch researcher  Mirjam Tuk  who found that people with full bladders make better decisions 
label1 So  first there was PlayStation  aka PS1  then PS2  PS3 and now PS4  And that makes sense  You'd think after Xbox  there'd be Xbox 2  But no  next came Xbox 360  Hmm ? And now  after 360  comes Xbox One  Why one ? Maybe that's how many seconds of thought they put into naming it 
label1 You know  however  with the Xbox One  I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands  Up until now  I've had to use Leonard 
label1 Yeah  well  it's true  But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating 
label1 No  see ? Well  you absolutely would not  And furthermore  the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included 
label1 Yes  Not sold separately  Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR 5 RAM  while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR 3 memory 
label1 See ? That's what I thought  But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer 
label1 Thank you again for dinner 
label1 Good night 
label1 Oh  of course 
label1 Well  they do 
label1 Quick poll  PS4 or Xbox One ? Raj ?
label1 Bernadette ?
label1 Thanks  Grandma 
label1 You know  I'm proud of me  too  I've done all my research  I conducted an informal poll  and I've arrived at the rock-solid certainty I've made the right choice 
label1 Oh  it is  Although 
label1 I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS 
label1 Yeah  a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil / Lehrer Report  Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray 
label1 Yeah  exactly  It's an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox 
label1 But what if I'm wrong ?
label1 Well  yeah  okay  sure  But which one ?
label1 Interesting 
label1 A quarter 
label1 On the one hand  the Xbox One has a better camera  but the PS4 has a removable hard drive  Thoughts ?
label1 But I haven't decided yet 
label1 I don't know  Hey  look  a quarter 
label1 Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist  What I'd like to know is  how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street ? You know ? Who's looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns ?
label1 Why would I be jealous ?
label1 Yeah  well  I've had a lot on my plate  We happen to live in a golden age of television 
label1 Really ? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry ?
label1 Why would you do that ? You're a string theorist as well 
label1 I couldn't sleep 
label1 No  that's not it 
label1 All right  I've devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions  I've got nothing to show for it  and I feel like a fool 
label1 You mean your acting career ?
label1 Your relationship with Leonard ?
label1 I said Leonard  you said no 
label1 Okay  Well  what do you do ?
label1 I don't know if I can do that 
label1 Break it off  shake hands  walk away 
label1 Gentlemen  is anybody interested in my old string theory books ?
label1 I am  Yeah  Penny pointed out that what I'm going through is essentially a breakup  And according to Cosmopolitan magazine  one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship 
label1 Yes  As it turns out  there's an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue  Anyway  it suggests that I set these on fire  but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas 
label1 Oh  that's just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface 
label1 It was  This seemed so elegant at the time  but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places 
label1 I know  As hard as this is  I have to move on  I can't keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return  I have needs  too 
label1 The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look 
label1 You stop it 
label1 Oh  how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla ?
label1 Oh  I'm in your hands  Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS 
label1 Oh  there are so many exciting areas  Black holes  dark matter 
label1 Don't feel bad  Neither does he 
label1 Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla ?
label1 I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band  Of course  I'd be the dreamy one and the smart one 
label1 Oh  looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry  Why do we have a geology book ? Leonard  did you throw a children's party while I was in Texas ?
label1 Let me put this in a way you'll understand  Penny  You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren't real celebrities ? Well  geology is the Kardashians of science 
label1 Have you considered studying standard model physics ?
label1 You want me to give up string theory for something that's less advanced ? You know  why don't you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear ?
label1 Oh  please  If I wanted to take up a fad  I'd get a tramp stamp 
label1 That's actually not bad advice  You know  I didn't seek out string theory  It just hit me over the head one day 
label1 A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find 
label1 No more than Penny 
label1 Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
label1 Oh  no  What have I done ?
label1 Not so good 
label1 It's not my friend  Nothing happened 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  Where's Amy ?
label1 Oh  I should call her and apologize  Oh  no 
label1 Apparently  I called Stephen Hawking last night 
label1 Not really  I had a bit of an embarrassing evening 
label1 I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking 
label1 Clogzilla  That's pretty funny  I don't think that's gonna pass 
label1 Leonard  I could use your assistance 
label1 Well  now that I've given up string theory  I'm struggling to find my next area of focus  So  in your professional opinion  which of these areas do you think is the most promising ?
label1 That's helpful  Okay  Of these four areas '
label1 I don't know  What do you want to do ?
label1 Hmm  what can we do that's fun ?
label1 Oh  got it  We order a pizza 
label1 You're right  You're right  Got it  We order calzones  cut them open  eat them like pizza  All right  all right  I'll shake the brain bush one more time  see what falls out  Got it  There's a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings 
label1 Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park ?
label1 Well  she talks a lot  She always wants to hold hands 
label1 Well  if you were referring to her illness your question should have been  what ails her ?
label1 Oh  Who knows ?
label1 So  we're just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online ?
label1 Great  You know  this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday 
label1 Fusion and Asians ? I'm trying not to think about science 
label1 That's a good question 
label1 And Amy  you told me you were sick  but you look just as pale and tired as always 
label1 Where are we going ?
label1 Okay  ' Cause if I had to pick now  I'd probably go with dark matter because '
label1 My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity 
label1 Not at all 
label1 But to be fair  when you talk  most of what you say sounds like  wah  wah  wah  clothes  wah  wah  wah 
label1 I am  So much so that I'm gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night 
label1 Penny  there's only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life's problems  and that's an Oreo  Or a Nutter Butter  if you're in a pinch 
label1 This is Asian fusion  For all you know  there's a tiny Chihuahua in here 
label1 No  it's not 
label1 Turn to you for wisdom ? Clearly  that cookie is mocking you  You'd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter 
label1 Have you ever paid for a meal ?
label1 Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you 
label1 Oh  That's a lot of incense  Or someone set a hippie on fire 
label1 I don't mean to be rude or discourteous  but before we begin  I'd just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind  Which means  and again  no insult intended  that you're a fraud  your profession is a swindle  and  uh  your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people  Again  no offence 
label1 For your information  I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie 
label1 Ha  The opposite  She's a neurobiologist  and I'm a theoretical physicist  My spirit guides can go suck an egg 
label1 You know what this is ? Yeah  and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it's truly deserved  This is malarkey 
label1 Hello  I didn't expect you this evening 
label1 Gentlemen  Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching  We should finalize our plans 
label1 Get it ?
label1 Yes  Actually  I'm glad you're here  I'm working on the Star Wars Day schedule  Now  I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining  but I'm worried an hour won't be enough time 
label1 What is it ?
label1 Professor Proton is dead ?
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 Your heart might be in the right place  but your head  chest and arms certainly aren't 
label1 But  that's Star Wars Day 
label1 I'm fine 
label1 Hmm  Yes  Look at him  Amy  It's such a shame  Struck down in the prime of my life 
label1 Oh  I'm not going to the funeral 
label1 All those people blowing their noses  You can't tell the sick from the sad  Mm  I'll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day  as planned 
label1 Amy  mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time 
label1 If we were in a physical relationship  you just lost sex tonight 
label1 Uh  no  thank you 
label1 I'm fine 
label1 Oh  I appreciate the offer  but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it  When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan  did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral ?
label1 Arthur Jeffries was a scientist  I'm sure he didn't care about silly superstitions like funerals  You know  if he were here  I think he'd say enjoy Star Wars Day 
label1 Okay  here we go  Episode I : The Phantom Menace 
label1 Howard  I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it 
label1 Get rid of the trade route part ? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office ? How would he get himself elected ? How ? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous ?
label1 Well  you know what else was just a suggestion ? Why don't we change the Raisin Bran box ? Hmm ? And you know who got hurt by that ? Every single person who eats breakfast 
label1 Look at Arthur  cracking up at a joke I told him  I'll never hear that laugh again 
label1 Arthur  I thought you were dead 
label1 I know why  You've come to me because you're my Obi-Wan 
label1 Wow  Uh  you're dead  so I'm going to let that slide  Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars  After his physical demise  he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form 
label1 You must be here to give me advice 
label1 Those are your Jedi robes 
label1 Be careful with that 
label1 This is the swampland of Dagobah  It's where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi 
label1 That's it ? I thought there'd be more of a reason why you're here 
label1 I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing 
label1 Oh  no  No  I've already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr  Whos 
label1 Of course  my grandfather died when I was five  My father died when I was 14 
label1 But I do appreciate them 
label1 I do  After I make them go back and watch one through five first 
label1 That's true  Oh  it's a good thing I had a nap 
label1 Wow  A Death Star cake 
label1 You're back 
label1 That's nice 
label1 Why do I need you now ?
label1 Not at all 
label1 I know  Let's go see the new Spider-Man movie 
label1 I thought that subject had run its course  so I changed it  It's called reading the room  Amy 
label1 Ah  very good  Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust 
label1 I know 
label1 Thanks for coming with me 
label1 I brought my own  No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes 
label1 Well  until they invent nose condoms  I'm not finding out 
label1 Oh  yes  you're the dermatologist  I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen  Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about ?
label1 That was awkward  right ?
label1 Is it because she's dating you but was out with that other fellow ?
label1 Good  I thought she saw something on my forehead 
label1 No  I do  You're upset about Emily and you're Indian  I need to make you chai tea  Now  I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds  Do you happen to have any on you ?
label1 Slick  huh ?
label1 Have you had intercourse ?
label1 Well  stick to your guns  There will be a lot of pressure 
label1 An interesting question  Well  good night 
label1 That's your problem  You can't be alone 
label1 How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion ?
label1 I was trying to suggest chemical castration  but it's my bedtime  so whatever gets you out the door  Good night 
label1 So  who's watching her now ?
label1 I just got called into President Siebert's office  The university won't let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology  They're forcing me to continue with string theory 
label1 He said it's why they hired me  it's  it's what my grant was designated for  and that everybody has to do things they don't want to do  He then gave an example of something he had to do  even though he didn't want to  which was look at my stupid face 
label1 It's an outrage  Honestly  I'm tempted to leave the university 
label1 I don't know  I am really aggravated 
label1 I'm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate  so that I can move on from string theory 
label1 You're right  I'll take that out 
label1 Oh  yeah  well  I've already given this some thought  and I'm willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period  Now  obviously  not when she's made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining 
label1 I don't understand  How could we all live together if I'm not there ?
label1 Where are you going to go ?
label1 Move across the hall ? Did you take a marijuana ?
label1 Did you get hit on the head with a coconut ?
label1 Well  then  I'm all out of guesses  What ? Me move across the hall  Why would you even suggest such a thing ?
label1 I see  You're putting your future bride's happiness above mine 
label1 How dare the university force me to go back to string theory ?
label1 Yeah  and on top of that  Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged  he may not want to live with me any more 
label1 Ugh  it's like walking into the Amazon  And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping  The awful one with birds and snakes 
label1 Four keys ! Who does he think he is  a warden ?
label1 I don't know  Perhaps 
label1 You and oh  sure  and while we're at it  why don't we get engaged  too ? Why don't we get a little house  start a family ? Enjoy our sunset years together ? Do you hear yourself  woman ?
label1 No  Here's a thought  You're not moving in  Leonard's not moving out  everything stays exactly the way it is  And by the way  I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup  you're supposed to use the powder 
label1 No  The syrup tastes better and I don't like it 
label1 And you couldn't put it out ?
label1 So when will you reopen ?
label1 So  tomorrow ?
label1 Your life ? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me  And now  the place I need to go when I'm sad is damp and smells funny 
label1 No  I do not accept this  Everything is changing and I hate it  It stops now  I'm helping you get back on your feet  I would like to purchase this comic book  please 
label1 Can you break a twenty ?
label1 You know what ? I don't always recognize sarcasm  but I do right now  and I don't appreciate it  I'm sorry for your loss  But you're not the only one whose day has been a disaster 
label1 Boy  you chase one balloon for three miles 
label1 Don't be melodramatic  I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever 
label1 My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need  It's called living off the land 
label1 No  I've reached my breaking point  I need to leave  Now 
label1 It doesn't matter 
label1 I suppose it is  Except I have a credit card  And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick  And I'd sooner die than eat beans out of a can 
label1 Legoland is not the solution to everything  And it's too much of a scene since that movie came out 
label1 Good Lord  Padawan's the student  not the teacher 
label1 I will 
label1 Of course you are 
label1 Excuse me  Is it at all possible that you're knitting a pair of pants ? Oh  well  no  you're understandably terrified  But  you know  allow me to explain  45 days ago  um  I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory  and my favorite comic book store burned down  and when my room mate got engaged  my girlfriend wanted to move in with me  which was no doubt a ploy just to see my  well  excuse my language  but my bathing suit parts  Uh  sir  may I use your phone ?
label1 Hello  Leonard 
label1 Leonard  I'm at the police station  I was robbed  They took my phone  my wallet  my iPad  everything 
label1 No  I'm not okay  Uh  I'm wearing borrowed pants  I don't have I  D   and one of the officers here won't stop calling me chicken legs 
label1 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue 
label1 Oh  yes  please  A pair of pants  And my toothbrush  Yeah  and my mail  And a really good comeback for chicken legs  because ' I know you are  but what am I ? was met with stony silence 
label1 Excuse me  Officer Hernandez ? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings ?
label1 Well  perhaps I can help  Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible  whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth  Now  have  have you tried doing that ?
label1 Well  maybe you should  There's lots of books called Sherlock Holmes  and there's no books called Officer Hernandez 
label1 Any word on my stolen items ?
label1 You know  Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus  But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick 
label1 Leonard  Oh  I'm so happy to see you 
label1 Oh  I'm fine  Why did you come ?
label1 I do  but  I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers 
label1 Where didn't I go ? I went to New York  Chicago  Atlanta  Denver  Seattle 
label1 Oh  I have no idea  I never left the train station 
label1 Why would I ? That's where all the cool trains are 
label1 Or had a single piece of fruit 
label1 At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station  Heinz ketchup  At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station  Heinz ketchup  At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station ?
label1 Wrong  Hunt's  Hey  Amy  what do you say ? You ready to move on to the mustard round ?
label1 I just thought you were bad at the game 
label1 Amy  may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate ?
label1 Well  I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog  but that'll work  Please ? This'll be quick  Leonard ? As soon as we get home  I want to have coitus with Amy  Okay  she can't hear  The reason I called you is because I didn't want Amy to know I couldn't make it on my own 
label1 Oh  of course it's no big deal to you  You idolize me  and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on 
label1 Amy just hurt my feelings  I want to break up with her 
label1 I wish I'd never gone on that trip  I feel no better now than when I left 
label1 That I couldn't do it ?
label1 That's a good point  You know  I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey  He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White  I was robbed of my phone and pants  and I  too  came back stronger  And whiter  too  ' cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks 
label1 Indeed  I was the world's smartest caterpillar  And then after pupating in our nation's railway system  I've burst forth as the world's smartest butterfly 
label1 Yeah  I feel renewed  I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way 
label1 Your hair is different  You changed your hair  I can't take this  I'm out 
label1 Would you like to see pictures from my trip ?
label1 Yeah  it did  but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud 
label1 I know  You know  I almost died in a fire in Des Moines  but I stayed put  FYI  that's when the Imodium gave out 
label1 I recently read that during World War Two  Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas 
label1 Yeah  the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala  You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked 
label1 The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses  Moving on 
label1 I'm sensing awkwardness  am I right ?
label1 It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms  McDonald to forget the quiz 
label1 Thank you  I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory ?
label1 That's the one  I believe you went last  so  uh  please ?
label1 But if I'm a professor  then I'll have to teach a class 
label1 So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists ?
label1 You people are sick 
label1 Awful  They're allowing me to move on from string theory  but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class 
label1 What a stupid question 
label1 I can't believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers 
label1 Wrong  Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do 
label1 A valid point  but unoriginal  B-minus 
label1 It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings  Feynman  Einstein  Professor X  Humorously  in the case of Professor X  some of his students actually had wings  That's rich  I'll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm 
label1 There is no class 
label1 No one signed up 
label1 I called the department secretary to see what happened  Apparently  I have a reputation for being obnoxious 
label1 Oh  yes  Fig Newtons  I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him ? And then after someone said Newton  I was going to tell them they're wrong  The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts  And then I'd throw the cookies away 
label1 Why would you do that ?
label1 Oh  Howard  I appreciate the gesture  but this is a graduate-level physics class  I don't think you'd understand a single thing I was talking about 
label1 How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution ?
label1 Hmm  Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X  without looking it up ?
label1 You take that back 
label1 I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard  Why are you telling me this ?
label1 Amy  please  I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine 
label1 I'm a teacher  Leonard  It's my job 
label1 Interesting point  You're suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour  thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority 
label1 Leonard ?
label1 Howard's allergic to peanuts  How can I use that against him ?
label1 Okay  now that everyone's here  we can begin 
label1 I suppose that's a fair request  There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience 
label1 Okay  Well  then  uh  first things first  Um  are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem ?
label1 Good  And how it relates to the calculus of variations ?
label1 Wonderful  Now  what about Euler-Lagrange theorems ?
label1 Ha ! I knew it  All right  We have a lot of information to cover before your first test  Which  by the way  is in eight minutes  The good news is I'm grading on a curve  so you're pretty much guaranteed a C 
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 Now  where was I ? Let's see  Oh  yes  Over here  You What are you doing now ?
label1 You're not going to do that  and I'll tell you why  This is an institution of higher learning  I am your professor  and you're going to treat me with the prop You shot your spit in my mouth !
label1 Can't talk  Spitball  Probably gonna die 
label1 You violated the sanctity of my mouth 
label1 I told you you weren't smart enough to take it 
label1 Yeah  try me 
label1 Young's modulus 
label1 Laminate the core material 
label1 Oh ! It's not even Easter time  This is crazy 
label1 Well  not just him  May I remind you that you're talking to the seeker  beater  chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team 
label1 Did you enjoy my lecture ?
label1 Well  if you're going to serve Cornish game hen  you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it 
label1 Good  I had Cornish game hen 
label1 If you're free tomorrow night  I'd love to have you join us on a double date 
label1 Oh  Well  then come or don't  I don't care 
label1 Yeah  which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding 
label1 Ignore them  Amy  They're just jealous because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours 
label1 I wasn't making a joke  I was merely stating fact  Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours 
label1 Leonard  I assumed you knew  The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy  Howard and Bernadette  Raj and his girlfriend  Penny and Chardonnay  Penny and you 
label1 For starters  we enjoy spending time together 
label1 It's called parallel play 
label1 Not as well as we do 
label1 Oh  listen to them  Not even married and the honeymoon's over 
label1 If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract  I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U  S  Constitution  And it may not be cool to say so  but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today 
label1 It has avocado on it  She's allergic to avocado  Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die ?
label1 Everything is quantifiable  That French fry ? A seven  Spider-Man ? A nine  The number nine ? Oddly  only a four 
label1 No  I'm not  French fries have three variables  crispiness  saltiness and shape  Which is why a curly fry only gets a two  If I wanted curls for dinner  I'd order a clown wig 
label1 Not according to the work of Berscheid  Snyder and Omoto 
label1 Yeah  not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory  That's pure Cooper 
label1 Kind of ? It does it perfectly 
label1 Why ? We won  You know  I say  next  we take on Koothrappali and his dog  Really give ourselves a challenge 
label1 The answer is one simple test away  Hmm ? You know  it's like when I thought there was a possum in my closet  Did I sit around wondering ? No  I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag 
label1 Or a one  A one is possible 
label1 We got an eight-point-two  Trust me  you're happy 
label1 Whoa  Nobody said anything about watching the game 
label1 Who's the bobblehead of ?
label1 No  as long as it bobbles 
label1 Okay  new plan  We go to Disneyland  play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer's Island  and then come back and see the end of the pitch 
label1 He makes a valid point 
label1 Oh  I think that sounds wonderful 
label1 Yes  but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot 
label1 Speaking of which  according to a recent study out of Oxford University  when someone takes on a new romantic partner  that person loses one or two close friends 
label1 I go to the bathroom like everybody else 
label1 Oh  I like their emergency room  Yeah  even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever  they still let you take a lollipop 
label1 I have some odd freckles on my buttocks  Can I make an appointment for you to look at them ?
label1 I miss Stuart's place  All this loud music and exposed brick  What  is this a comic book store  or a rave at the third little pig's house ?
label1 Oh  boy  if there is one thing that gets my goat  it's those dad-gum insurance companies 
label1 For starters  they shed and bite 
label1 I'll give you a plan right now  Step one  open comic book store  Step two  start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts  Step three  buy a big bag to put the money in 
label1 On the bright side  that Oxford study was right  One friend down  I wonder who you're going to lose next 
label1 No  You're crazy about me 
label1 You know  the more I think about it  the more intrigued I am about having our own store 
label1 And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers  Like  this isn't a library  buy it or get out 
label1 Yes  but as a store owner  I'll finally have a good comeback to  You don't work here  shut up 
label1 I'm sure she did 
label1 Yeah  he's right  Once  in a moment of candour  I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill  She stormed out  Which was sad  because we were playing Scrabble  and I had all the letters to spell persimmon 
label1 I know that if I had a wife or a fianc'e  I'd ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store 
label1 I'd like your honest opinion on something 
label1 Now  before I start  I need you to know that I'm very excited about this  and anything you say that isn't enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question  So  keep an open mind 
label1 Perfect  Now  I'm considering investing in Stuart's comic book store 
label1 Great  Wait till you hear about our van 
label1 It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours  where we could just sit and read comics in peace 
label1 Well  I guess it was too good to be true 
label1 Why  die  Why did he die ? Old  told  I was told he was old 
label1 Well  don't feel bad  I think we've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives 
label1 Oh  very much so  Listen to this  This is from two days ago  Hi  Hope you're having a good day  Who has time for this constant sexting ?
label1 I'm not going to a cabin in the woods  Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods ?
label1 A hotel ? Did you see The Shining ?
label1 Did you see The Lake House ?
label1 Yeah  well  no  not to them  To me  Time traveling mailbox  The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet 
label1 Well  you didn't suggest a beach house 
label1 Well  good Lord  no  have you seen Jaws ?
label1 Yeah  one would assume  on getting out of the pit 
label1 Thinking caps on 
label1 Really ?
label1 Yeah  I have it on Blu-ray  We should watch it 
label1 I'm sorry  Is that a no ?
label1 I did not get a clear answer  I'm gonna set this down now 
label1 Wait  I'm confused  Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute ?
label1 You know  a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction  The  the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C  Clarke  The Motorola flip phone  that came from Star Trek  And I've long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact 
label1 If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty's hover board  that would have universal application 
label1 Wait  Whoa  whoa  Is placed right ?
label1 Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future ?
label1 Yeah  but he had will haven't placed it !
label1 Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine  this couldn't be more simple  When Biff gets the almanac in 1955  the alternate future he creates isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015  Therefore  in the new timeline  Marty and Doc never brought the time machine '
label1 Marty and Doc never had have had brought ?
label1 Oh  I'm going with it  Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015  That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff  Therefore  the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac  And not just never gets  Never have  never hasn't  never had have hasn't 
label1 Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna  or Wien ?
label1 Oh  this is already better  There are far fewer distractions in here 
label1 Well  I wonder if anyone's tried that 
label1 Yeah  exactly  Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong ?
label1 Mmm  not bad  You know  in medieval times  idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold's bridle  It's an iron cage that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue 
label1 Oh  I'll check Amazon 
label1 Ow  That was your fault 
label1 I think you mean positive punishment  Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus  It's a common mistake 
label1 Oh  it's used incorrectly all the time  Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters 
label1 Leonard's right  We can't just jump ahead  We have to watch the whole movie 
label1 But we didn't see them bust one ghost 
label1 I started doing it 
label1 Why not ?
label1 Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock at you having something cleaned 
label1 Are they making fun of us ?
label1 I miss the old days when I couldn't tell 
label1 I'm always busy  This mind is capable of advanced multitasking  You know  currently  I'm attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture  I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I've solved the Penrose conjecture  and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies 
label1 Now I've got room for another thing  What do you want ?
label1 Well  I'm from Texas and you're from India  we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit  Next 
label1 Yeah  I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream  Next 
label1 Yeah ? We have to be somewhere 
label1 Very well 
label1 Well  I'll just Google hot  dark and moist  see what comes up 
label1 Well  according to my research  the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines 
label1 All right  Amy  this walkie-talkie is yours  If we run into any problems  I'll contact you  And if anything bad happens  what's the rule ?
label1 Well  admittedly  this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat  small places  going below floor-level  dampness  hatches  ladders  darkness  echoes  and eliminating in Home Depot buckets  That last one is quite new  but I have a feeling that's gonna rocket to the top of the list 
label1 Yeah  as the person beneath you  allow me to say  I know 
label1 Uh  let's see  704 ? No  wait  it's on clock  Uh  the real answer isn't much better  102 degrees 
label1 Good  Little claustrophobic 
label1 Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up 
label1 Just the hits 
label1 Well  I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll  that my body will blacken and turn into coal 
label1 Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home  and pity the miner that mines my poor bones 
label1 Who's he ?
label1 That's preposterous  How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig ?
label1 He doesn't just put on a pair of glasses  He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality 
label1 I told you to use the walkie-talkie !
label1 Please keep this channel clear for emergencies  Thank you 
label1 This is a simulation  We have to survive on the supplies we brought 
label1 You're not going to have Funyuns when we're a mile below the surface of the Earth 
label1 We'll take some Funyuns 
label1 As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India  you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature 
label1 My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay 
label1 We're not stopping 
label1 I apologize  I just  I'm plagued by an internal struggle 
label1 My struggle is emotional 
label1 It's dark matter  When I entered the field of string theory  I was a prodigy  I rose to a position of respect  and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory  Now here I am in my 30s  I'm back at square one  And  frankly  it's frightening 
label1 Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show ?
label1 Good  Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show 
label1 You're not doing it for me  You're doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle 
label1 His statements of the obvious continue to annoy 
label1 No  thank you  Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation's commerce  It's because of people like you  people like me can limit our human contact  I'd shake your hand  but  well  you know 
label1 That's humorous 
label1 Yeah  I bet you leave your patients in stitches  That was also humorous 
label1 Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis ? That wasn't a joke 
label1 Hmm  You know  they have delivery people that will do that for you 
label1 Making the extra effort  Good for you 
label1 Ooh  Siam Palace ?
label1 Uh  mee krob and chicken satay ?
label1 Uh  extra peanut sauce ?
label1 Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce ? We can both play this game 
label1 So have these two  and they're having dinner with us 
label1 Here you go  Doctor  Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey 
label1 Oh  please  you know  I'll tell you how he did it  Implacable  relentless badgering  In urology terms  he was a drug-resistant staph infection  And she was a urethra that could not shake him 
label1 So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled ?
label1 Leonard  I was wrong  Heaven does exist  And it's in the basement of a urologist's house in Sherman Oaks 
label1 Yes  If you'd like to join in  the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure 
label1 Oh  if you want to get in on the pool  you're too late  All the squares have been purchased 
label1 Leonard  as your friend I feel I should tell you something 
label1 I'm still upset about that peanut sauce 
label1 No  I'd look silly in that helmet 
label1 Oh  this day just keeps getting better 
label1 You can do this 
label1 You think you've got problems  The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape 
label1 All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one  That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground  Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef 
label1 True  Sorry  kid  you've got it worse than a gibbon 
label1 Next time I might be in a rush  it's good to have a few in the bank 
label1 We pretend we're aliens  I'm not the best at reading facial cues  but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more  Now  in the beloved novel Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  which is a travel book within the actual book  which is also called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
label1 My point is  pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times  I did it the first time I went to see you in a play  You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience  Oh  don't worry  he gave you seven thumbs up 
label1 There are post-prom mating rituals ?
label1 Well  if it's part of the prom experience  then I'm open to it 
label1 I may be an alien  but I have urges  If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space  well  then  I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin  I'm not the best at reading facial cues  but I can see that you're a little turned on 
label1 His name is Alfred  and  yes  he does 
label1 Yes  I've decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom  including spiking the punch 
label1 Oh  everything  Getting our picture taken  slow-dancing  being elected prom king  Pointing out that kings aren't elected  It's gonna be off the hook 
label1 Penny implied the same thing  Is this true ?
label1 Thank you 
label1 Excuse me 
label1 According to an online message board  I may be having a panic attack  SoccerMom 09 had similar symptoms  But to be fair  the twins were a real handful that day 
label1 What's going on is we're about to go to a prom  And there's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr  Bob Eubanks called making whoopee 
label1 It's not just that  Leonard and Penny also made comments about it  And I'm not blind  Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants 
label1 I really did think you looked pretty 
label1 Yes  So much so that I started to panic 
label1 Were you hoping we would because it's prom ?
label1 Thank you for understanding 
label1 I love you  too 
label1 There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way  I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite  But that seems even more farfetched  The only conclusion was love  I know what's happening  This is a panic attack  SoccerMom 09 says to lie down with your feet elevated 
label1 Whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  Just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room 
label1 Still think it's me 
label1 Of course there is  The Mini Cooper  ' cause it's me 
label1 Oh  Tesla 
label1 But you don't have a life-threatening condition  Why would you take the risk of surgery ?
label1 Yes  for the first five or six years  but I've gotten used to it  It helps me sleep  He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine 
label1 Very well  I'm done talking about it 
label1 I believe it was your turn in the game 
label1 Let's see  Oh  this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous  disfigured freak 
label1 I don't  I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo 
label1 I'm listening to you snore  I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it 
label1 Really Leonard  Insults ? After I spent two hours in your closet  waiting for you to fall asleep ?
label1 I have to be honest with you Leonard  I'm truly worried 
label1 Well  I've been doing some research and I've learned that one in 700000 people die from general anaesthesia 
label1 Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery  there was a one-in -700000 chance of dying ?
label1 Well  I've been crunching the numbers  and so far  I've gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300 
label1 Leonard  what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon's latex gloves ?
label1 Well  then why don't you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes ?
label1 I do  I have the drive to the hospital right here  That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs  And don't expect me to carry you  I do that enough in life 
label1 You don't know that 
label1 You know who else said that ? Every cocky T  Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car 
label1 I don't know  I'm smart and scrappy  I think I'd find a way 
label1 18 parts per million  And he's still doing it 
label1 Although now that I think about it  Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt 
label1 No  but last year  at Magic Mountain  he got such a bad sunburn  we had to cut him out of it 
label1 You're acting odd  Why ?
label1 Tell me the truth 
label1 Come on 
label1 Amy  What's going on ?
label1 I see  Take me to Leonard 
label1 Amy  he's my best friend  and if you don't take me  I'm going there anyway 
label1 I do  And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn't at his bedside to say I told you so 
label1 Oh  stop it  I assume this medical centre's already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire 
label1 That's for the fire marshal to determine 
label1 Very well 
label1 That's a good idea  Penny  did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements ?
label1 Oh  this isn't for Leonard  no  Amy bought it for me 
label1 You know those confounded things make me dizzy 
label1 There was a large plant in the lobby  It kept looking like the outside 
label1 It was like a grapefruit 
label1 Well  I'm not making any promises  Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk  he deceived me 
label1 And I'm not ? It's an earthquake  I knew it 
label1 A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy  Oh  I don't care for this at all  Oh  I need to see he's okay 
label1 Try and stop me 
label1 I told you not to get the surgery 
label1 Wow  I don't know which hurts worse  my nose or my heart  Well  I'm done speaking to you 
label1 Oh  you're hardly out of the woods  no  You still run the risk of infection  a blood clot  the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose  The minute you sneeze web  I'm moving out 
label1 I was not panicked  and I am not overly attached to Leonard 
label1 Yeah  Tell me those aren't the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain  Amy  you're a neuroscientist  Crack his skull open  spray some Raid in there 
label1 Oh  I ordered it before your surgery  It's the urn I was going to put you in 
label1 I can't send it back  I had it engraved  Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter  He thought he was right  but his room mate knew better  '
label1 Oh  that one's mine 
label1 Hello  I'm Doctor Sheldon Cooper  and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags  the final episode flagtacular  I knew it was coming  Still scary  Now  I'm sure you're thinking  the final episode ? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance ?
label1 But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career  a popular Internet show  and a girlfriend 
label1 And you said you pressed record  Anyway  please sit back  relax  and join us as we take our final lap  as indicated by the waving of this racing flag  And  of course  white flags can also represent surrender  the Stewards of Gondor  and the Japanese Minamoto clan  but I'm sure you remember that from episode sixty-two  White Flags  Who's Wavin ' Em and Why ?
label1 It was so good 
label1 Over the years here at Fun With Flags  we've had an opportunity to learn  laugh  wonder 
label1 Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn't get recorded 
label1 How about four thousand  One for every domino I set up to make that American flag  Please enjoy these highlights 
label1 Crikey  what flag do we have today ?
label1 And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag 
label1 I have no idea  Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock 
label1 Don't ask me  I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck 
label1 Fancy a dip  my dear ?
label1 No  This is  Stop looking at my legs 
label1 Welcome back  Our guest today is a returning fan favourite  He puts the reading in your rainbow  the Geordi in your La Forge  and the Kunta in your Kinte  Mr  LeVar Burton 
label1 You do this  I delete your contact information 
label1 While you watch me do it 
label1 Well  since you're here  I'd like to get your opinion on something  In honour of Black History Month  I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist  What do you think ?
label1 You heard him  Leonard  No  it's not racist 
label1 Well  my little flag-keteers  it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end  If I could  I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you  And if you touched the ground  burn you  I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr  Amy Farrah Fowler  who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show 
label1 And if I may get serious for a moment  hosting this show has been one crazy ride  But with all its ups and downs  I wouldn't give it up for the world  Except for now  when I'm giving it up  Before I sign off  I'd  uh  I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag  It's good for times like this  Good night 
label1 If you didn't press record '
label1 It's not the same thing  I don't think you know how I feel at all 
label1 Hmm  You do get me  Someone left a comment 
label1 Too bad your show is done  I kind of liked it  Leonard  did you hear that ? Oh  the people are heartbroken  I can't take this away from the world  Fun with Flags is back 
label1 Let's celebrate 
label1 Oh  no  I'm not going to drink it  I just wanted to hear the pop  Yeah  I knew it was coming  Still scary 
label1 You told me not to call  and I didn't know how else to give you the good news  Fun with Flags is back  and you can be in the next episode 
label1 You  at least listen to the premise  Since you were born in Germany  I thought we could talk
label1 You know  speaking of attorneys  if I ever needed a lawyer  I would not hire She-Hulk 
label1 Yes  but she's the only monster at the firm  Between you  me and the wall  I think she's an affirmative action hire 
label1 Ugh  English pudding  You get yourself all excited for pudding  and here comes a cake with raisins in it  I'm not going 
label1 Why do you hate me ?
label1 Well  you call it love  but it has a lot of raisins in it 
label1 Yeah  I appreciate the ride 
label1 Because in the last ten minutes  Santa came to town  kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer  I had a drunk uncle who did all those things  Nobody sings songs about him 
label1 My uncle was accused of that  too  It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma 
label1 Oh  we're not exchanging gifts 
label1 Yes  and she's not taking my feelings into account at all  Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson 
label1 Hmm  It'd have to be something heinous  something that makes her as miserable as she's making me  Oh  I've got it  This is good 
label1 I'm going to buy her a present 
label1 With gift-giving  there's an implied social contract  If I show up tonight with a present  and she doesn't have one for me  she'll feel terrible 
label1 Yes  Maybe she'll feel so guilty  she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again 
label1 That's right  So stay on my good side  or I'll get you a little something  too 
label1 No  it's not good enough  It has to be perfect 
label1 Hmm  Let's see  what do I know about Amy ? She loves medieval literature  Chaucer's her favourite  And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies  I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she's playing along 
label1 I do  Now  let's find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless 
label1 Correct 
label1 There's an argument for that  But I want to make sure 
label1 If you like raisins 
label1 Oh  Oh  in that case  it was pretty good 
label1 Uh  what do you say we exchange gifts ?
label1 Yeah  I do  Which is why I got Amy this 
label1 Oh  not just something  no  It's from the heart  it's holiday-themed  and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it 
label1 Of course it is  It's the perfect gift  How are you feeling right now ? Guilty ? Sad ? Wishing you were Jewish ?
label1 But what about our agreement ?
label1 Cookies ?
label1 They're perfect  It tastes like her hugs 
label1 I can't believe this  You're happy  I'm happy  Well  maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so Get your hand out of that box 
label1 What colour would you like to be ?
label1 That's not true  Any colour's fine with me  Yeah  I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow 
label1 Oh  good news  we ordered lunch  so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk 
label1 Oh  no  we'll still be playing it tonight  this game can easily take eight hours 
label1 Yeah  well  you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth  now including the Haradwaith Territories 
label1 You want to be green ?
label1 Fine  Now that we're not playing  you can be green 
label1 And since you're green this time  I can be it next time 
label1 You know what you could make us do ? Ice-skating  The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni 
label1 Well  I'm sorry  Leonard  I'm a problem-solver  it's what I do 
label1 You should point out the hypocrisy of that 
label1 You're making it too complicated  Why not stick to the basics ? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses  hmm ? I know I'd hate that  Leonard ?
label1 Well  then  it's settled ?
label1 That's easy for you to say  Your chair's not facing the lingerie section  Boy  that's a lot of panties 
label1 I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes 
label1 They have a man there who understands my personal style 
label1 I'll look them up  Son of a biscuit 
label1 No  it's not fine  What kind of store in the 21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi ? I'm going to call their corporate office  Son of a biscuit 
label1 Let's see  my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland  And I roll a five and a three 
label1 Oh  that's true  I suppose it's only fair we make compromises 
label1 I don't know why you're so surprised  If there's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years  it's how to compromise 
label1 All the time 
label1 Oh  I learned how  Amy taught me 
label1 Uh  well  it's scary  And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up  But  more importantly  driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose  I can't take that away from you  so what do I do ? Oh  come on  I'm practically feeding you the answer  I compromise 
label1 Oh  here's another one  I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A  but I don't put it there because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs when you're supposed to be making my breakfast 
label1 I wasn't done  but go ahead  He said  compromising 
label1 Well  you're a physicist  not a circus clown 
label1 Is that true ?
label1 Well  given my history on the subject  t seems a little reckless to bring it up now 
label1 You know what ? You think you're so tolerant  but the truth is you're mean to me a lot  Yeah  you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls  but I do  Hmm ? I have excellent peripheral vision  On a good day  I can see my ears 
label1 Well  I'm sorry  too  And if you want to live with Penny  then I think you should 
label1 Yes  Yeah  just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life 
label1 It's okay 
label1 I understand  Either way  I want you to know that I'm aware of how difficult I can be  So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me 
label1 Well  what if you did it gradually ?
label1 How about one night and I let you whistle ?
label1 When I'm not home 
label1 There we go  compromising again  We really are the best 
label1 It's not a basket  It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China 
label1 I saw that 
label1 Before you leave  could you test these noise-cancelling headphones ?
label1 Okay  Go ahead 
label1 Aw  now I'm sad I didn't hear it 
label1 Oh  I will  nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science 
label1 Okay  Here we go  Proton decay  Proton decay 
label1 How could there be  with these constant interruptions ?
label1 I'm not going to work today  And would you like to know why ?
label1 Like a big old baby 
label1 You sounded in distress  I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you  Like a murder  Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard 
label1 Well  if you hate it  then why are you doing it ? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard 
label1 And to clarify ?
label1 I'm not going  Would you like to know why ?
label1 Boy  I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am 
label1 Yeah  I was  but after talking to Penny  I realised something  I  first  she's trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are  And second  the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself 
label1 According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson  in order to maximize performance  one must create a state of productive anxiety  So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me  Keep me on my toes  Just throw me off my game  Essentially  go out of your way to make my life miserable 
label1 Well  I suppose '
label1 You know  I don't want to tell you how to do your job  but when a mouse completes a maze  it gets a food pellet 
label1 And his last meal was a food pellet ? You're a monster 
label1 I'm sorry  I was aiming for your heart 
label1 Perhaps this was a waste of time 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Only do solid research ? I come to you for help  and you insult me ? I thought the least that you would do would be '
label1 Really ? Oh  that's fantastic  Now  wait  they're dropping  Why are they dropping ?
label1 Oh  no  it will  See  by keeping my mind engaged  I'll become more focused 
label1 Stop fighting me on the premise  It's scientifically valid  I'm going to advance propositions  I just want you to challenge me 
label1 Why  of course it's what I want  Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want ?
label1 I ask you for one simple thing  and you can't even do it 
label1 Yeah  well  then do it 
label1 You guys are the worst  Thank you  I think that was helpful 
label1 Ladies 
label1 Well  as you may know  I've been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels  and I thought  what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk ?
label1 Well  conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex  You know  who has the best cervix  Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now  Men's buttocks  and how you want to pat and squeeze them 
label1 You talk about if werewolves can swim ? See  Leonard says yes  but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten  What do you think ?
label1 Thank you  Oh  and technically  it's apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full  Hey  this is fun  We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing  Bye 
label1 Oh  Uh  I need to keep my anxiety at the right level  so I'm using Darth Vader  the Joker  and Godzilla's roar to keep me in that sweet spot  Uh  I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix  but turns out I love her 
label1 Boy  Taylor was right  haters gonna hate  hate  hate  hate  hate 
label1 Of course 
label1 I can do both  My brain is working at optimal capacity  I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time 
label1 Oh  you said it 
label1 I know  It's replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety 
label1 He is getting a lot of work done  He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay 
label1 That nagging tone is helping my anxiety  yeah  But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill  that'd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah 
label1 There you go  perfect 
label1 Or do I  hmm ? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo 
label1 Yeah  well  maybe it is  maybe it isn't  I have been hallucinating lately 
label1 Amy  I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter  What if I stop doing this  and it all goes away ?
label1 Hmm  perhaps  But I'm not taking the cap off 
label1 Oh  really ? What if I don't ? And before you answer that  can I have my dessert ?
label1 And then she threw me out  Me  her very own boyfriend  When all I've done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in 
label1 I knew you'd understand  Armadillo Isaac Newton 
label1 Okay  Hey  I thought you were trying to trick me 
label1 No  I don't want to go to sleep  you can't make me 
label1 Yeah  darn straight  you can't  Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep 
label1 That's not gonna work 
label1 Oh  I'm feeling much better  And I've also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels 
label1 Of course not 
label1 Well  you could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one  And  ugh  the whole thing reeks of blueberry  You know I can't stand these scented markers 
label1 It's good 
label1 I like it  I think you're on to something 
label1 Not at all  In fact  I have got something for just such an occasion  I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you  Good job 
label1 Not just a sticker  That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow 
label1 Fine  I'll take it back 
label1 For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid  you're still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump 
label1 Oh  I did more than work out all the math  I wrote a paper 
label1 I wrote a paper on our idea 
label1 When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind 
label1 Well  the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright 
label1 We could  but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch 
label1 My name is right on there with yours  That is a surefire mark of quality  That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon 
label1 Come on  Click the mouse with me 
label1 Yes  we did  my friend 
label1 I don't want to talk about it 
label1 Does it smell like blueberries ?
label1 Oh  nice to meet you  Mr  Insightful 
label1 I do  indeed  Mr  Box-Thinking 
label1 Read another one 
label1 Who wrote that ?
label1 Look  I am simply going to defend our work  scientist to scientist  And failing that  suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers 
label1 He just left another comment 
label1 You mess with the bull  you get the horns  I'm about to show this guy just how horny I can be 
label1 Yeah  I do  Then no matter how he responds  I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh  really ?
label1 He wrote back  Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper  It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech  essentially a technical school  where even the physicists are basically engineers  Engineers ? Do you know how insulting that is ?
label1 Yeah  but it's still so aggravating 
label1 And send 
label1 I'm done hiding from bullies  I'm taking this into the real world 
label1 I told him we'll meet him face-to-face anytime  anywhere 
label1 Oh  okay  okay  calm down 
label1 Interesting  I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't say to someone's face 
label1 He's right  I say we call this person back  We've got no reason to hide 
label1 Click it with me  One  two  three  click 
label1 Good to see you again  Mr  Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper 
label1 How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
label1 Who cares ? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke 
label1 Of course  that's how you know it's a good joke  It not only entertains  it informs 
label1 Uh  Barry  uh  how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
label1 What do you want  Barry ?
label1 Since when do you help out Barry Kripke ?
label1 Oh  really ? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end  why didn't you try to help me ?
label1 I'm being petty ? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry  You heard him  he told me to suck eggs  If we were friends  he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant  Why are you laughing ? Did you learn something ?
label1 If I was okay  I would've said hello  and not the much more ominous hello 
label1 I'm mad at Amy 
label1 Well  it would be  except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end  Yeah  and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong  My rival  no less  I'm sorry you had to see that 
label1 Why would she do this to me ?
label1 Ugh  let it go  I have heard that my whole life  Every time something upsets me somebody says  let it go  you know  like it's my fault  and it's not okay to feel the way I feel 
label1 Is that all you have ? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go ? Gee  Penny  life's giving me lemons  What should I do ?
label1 Oh  give me that  Just out of curiosity  if I were to let something go  how would I do that ?
label1 Can I think about the spiny anteater ?
label1 The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke  That didn't help at all 
label1 But I just got this pen  It's got my initials on it and everything  Look 
label1 What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab ?
label1 Are you sure ?
label1 Okay  that's great  Now  let it go 
label1 Well  excuse me  Amy was testing you  I was rooting for you  Good job on that banana box  by the way 
label1 She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve  I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them  That's when Amy said  want to make this interesting ?
label1 No  no  We designed an experiment involving you  See ? Now  isn't that interesting ?
label1 Okay  maybe this will help  Imagine you're holding a pen  Before you go too far  not a special pen with your initials engraved on it  that'll make the next part really hard 
label1 I don't understand why you're mad at me  You should be mad at Amy  Like I was this afternoon  Hey  look at that  I let it go 
label1 I think I left my pen in there 
label1 Hang on 
label1 Thank you 
label1 That sounds like us  I still don't understand why you're upset  You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps 
label1 Oh  I can help you with that  Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen  While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket 
label1 May I say something ?
label1 When I lost my own father  I didn't have any friends to help me through it  You do 
label1 I didn't care for her yelling  But now that I'm not going to hear it again  I'm sad 
label1 It won't be as good 
label1 Oh  that's nonsense  I proclaimed my love for you  And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis 
label1 You didn't even let me finish 
label1 So  you can experiment on all the apes you want  But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings  suddenly I'm the monster 
label1 In the interest of science  I'd be willing to 
label1 Uh  fun fact  pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex  which means bridge builder or Pope 
label1 Just out of curiosity  Penny  if this experiment does make us fall in love  would you drive me to Lake Geneva  Wisconsin for Gary Con ? It's the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax  the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons 
label1 Okay  babe  let's do this 
label1 You ready to begin ?
label1 Well  as a Texas gentleman  I'm inclined to say ladies first  Although  I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins  Perhaps we should flip a coin  Or if you're familiar with the rules of Rock  Paper  Scissors '
label1 Hmm  Living or dead ?
label1 Ah  that's just as well  As much as I'd love to meet Euclid  inventor of the geometric proof  he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner  Oh  I know  the person I'd most like to have dinner with is myself 
label1 Oh  I didn't think of Iron Man  You know  maybe after myself and I have dinner  we can meet you two for dessert 
label1 What would constitute a perfect day for you ?
label1 That's it ?
label1 I don't think so  Leonard can't stand yoga  the beach  massages or dancing 
label1 Uh  I wake up  Uh  I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup  Uh  then a wormhole opens  and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race 
label1 Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup ?
label1 If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability  what would it be ?
label1 I believe what you're doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability 
label1 When are we going to get robot eyes ?
label1 Well  what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling  Like  I can't always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me  You know  like  uh  if they're mad at something I've done or just in a bad mood  It  it's incredibly stressful 
label1 Well  I'm not  And if I could read people's minds  life would be so much simpler 
label1 You sure it's not too much Bible juice ?
label1 So  it would be today ? Huh  Well  I suppose there's something satisfying about dying on my birthday 
label1 Well  I don't enjoy presents  And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director's Cut 
label1 The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other 
label1 Thank you 
label1 That's it  We're done with the questions 
label1 Okay  Wait  hang on  Bladder check  We're good to go 
label1 We're not supposed to talk during this part 
label1 Well  you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car  So I'm just concentrating on that  Plus  it's easier around people that I'm comfortable with 
label1 Oh  Well  I suppose I do think of you as a sister  And sometimes  a mother 
label1 It was a Monday afternoon  You joined us for Indian food 
label1 Yeah  and you're still eating our food 
label1 I remember it perfectly  But I have an eidetic memory  If you're interested  I also remember how much you owe us for the food 
label1 And I  you  And yes  that's how you say that  Yeah  so  given our newfound intimacy  I'd say we have some hard choices to make 
label1 Gary Con  do we fly or drive ? Do we wear costumes ? And if so  who gets to be Gary ?
label1 Thank you for walking me home 
label1 Oh  good  You're back 
label1 As you know  Amy and I have been together a long time  and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible 
label1 Do you want to say it ?
label1 Sarcasm ?
label1 No  It's true  It means that we care so much about each other  there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  Oh  dear Lord 
label1 Oh  I don't know  He kind of looks like a jerk  How about this one ?
label1 I know  I like him  too  Hi  little guy  How'd you like to come home with us ? You'll be living with me because we don't live in the same house 
label1 Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars 
label1 Oh  there's this company that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars  and I applied to be among the first to go  What should we name him ? You know  I came in thinking Seth  but he kind of looks Italian 
label1 Would you have approved ?
label1 Well  based on your reaction  it looks like I made the right choice  Isn't that right  Giuseppe ?
label1 I can't believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home 
label1 I was playing Got Your Nose  That's how you get children to like you 
label1 Ugh  this again  Amy  I've already had one new hole torn in my body today  I don't need another one 
label1 So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet ?
label1 Huh  that's exactly what Leonard  Wolowitz  Koothrappali  Bernadette and Penny said 
label1 First of all  this has only made me stronger  But beyond that  all I did was fill out an application 
label1 Is there anything I can do to cheer you up ?
label1 What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose ?
label1 Yep  you're mad 
label1 I was going to make you red zinger  but since Mars is the red planet  I went with peppermint 
label1 Actually  as part of the application  I was required to make a short video answering that very question  You want to see it ?
label1 But I made a video 
label1 Afterwards  Leonard blew his nose  and pie came out 
label1 Why ? I really don't understand what's happening here 
label1 Amy  Oh  why didn't I give her Sleepy Time tea ? Amy  wait  Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me  too 
label1 Do you want me to withdraw my application ?
label1 I am  Yeah  if I'm going to a barren  lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none  I want you there with me  Why don't we go back to the apartment  and fill out your application ?
label1 Oh  I know  We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars  We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks ! on Mars  We could be the first to say good lord  what on Mars are you talking about ?
label1 You just can't keep it in your space pants  can you ?
label1 They would  wouldn't they ? We could give them cool Martian names  And we could teach them about Martian history  Like  who planted those flags ? And  uh  where did that copy of Mars Attacks ! come from ?
label1 Good idea  And since you've had such a rough day  I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face 
label1 Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine  And that  little lady  is pi to a thousand places 
label1 Oh  look  it's the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote 
label1 Well  that can't be right 
label1 All I did was answer a few questions about the theory  And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards 
label1 Oh  maybe you're right  He is kind of a lump 
label1 Oh  I'd be incensed 
label1 Squeaky wheel gets the grease ?
label1 Grass is always greener ?
label1 But it wasn't my fault  I didn't exclude him  And I didn't write the article 
label1 Oh  that kid  Poor Leonard 
label1 For the record  that kid was a terrible choice  If you cry when you drop your churro  you do not have what it takes to rule England 
label1 Leonard ? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill ?
label1 Good  good  And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn't  And I'm okay with that 
label1 Oh  right  This is a disaster 
label1 Okay  I have to tell you something  but you're not going to like it 
label1 An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory 
label1 No  No  they loved it  They  uh  couldn't say enough nice things about it 
label1 You know how the PennySaver only has my name '
label1 They didn't mention you in the article  Only me 
label1 I know  It's not fair  Let the anger go  buddy  You just  you relax all your muscles  Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter  Let's keep those tight 
label1 It is  They're what hold back the urine and the faeces  Look  maybe  maybe you shouldn't read it  It'll only make you feel worse 
label1 You should know I had nothing to do with that 
label1 You know  you're right  Yeah  You know  it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man  Stan Lee may get all the credit  but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important  Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies  And  and he's far richer  And he's a household name  you know ? Whereas  you know  you say Ditko  and that sounds like a company that makes Dits 
label1 Well  I'd give more examples  but  well  everyone in your position's so forgettable 
label1 I spoke to the reporter at the magazine 
label1 He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist 
label1 Well  I know it was your idea  but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while  and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ' cause my name is on it 
label1 Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill ?
label1 Oh  That's just as well  They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up 
label1 Fine  Then Grumpy  what's he so grumpy about ? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side 
label1 Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does ?
label1 Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically ?
label1 Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn't correct him ?
label1 Hi  Hello  Oh  and a special hello to Leonard  who needs to be mentioned by name 
label1 But you got it  right ?
label1 Of course 
label1 Indeed  Penny  a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day 
label1 Oh  I'm aware  It features Whoopi Goldberg  She played Guinan on Star Trek : Next Gen  Penny  Next Gen refers to Star Trek '
label1 I don't believe it matters what the topic is  What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way  It's all about the execution 
label1 Well said  old chap  I thought eloquence had died  here it stands before us  Starting today  it'll go Gettysburg Address  I have a dream  and what he just said 
label1 Leonard  please  His mother just died 
label1 Yeah  so are you 
label1 Leonard  lots of people could've had that idea  but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did 
label1 Oh  well  apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world  including those fighting for our freedom  Yeah  well  I don't know about you  but I support our boys overseas 
label1 She said my name first  that must kill you 
label1 I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell 
label1 Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can't Spy ? It's all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum 
label1 I'll begin  Uh  I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us 
label1 I don't want to play anymore 
label1 I suppose it is  In fact  if you'd like to celebrate with a little music  I'd be okay with that 
label1 Play that funky music  white boy 
label1 So they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music  yes ?
label1 And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well ?
label1 Let me ask you this  Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays ?
label1 So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox  the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself ?
label1 Well then I hate it  Music should just be fun 
label1 Will our hotel room be ready ?
label1 Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective ?
label1 Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere  Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere  Hoth was in the middle of nowhere  That's code  Leonard  He wants us to drop in 
label1 Yes  Oh  I'm so excited  And I just can't hide it 
label1 What are you talking about ?
label1 There it is  It's just a gate  On a road 
label1 This is so amazing 
label1 I want more than a picture  I want to go in 
label1 Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny ?
label1 Well  get over it  Confidence is key in these situations 
label1 You pushed it  are you out of your mind ?
label1 All right  we've defeated the first challenge  Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate 
label1 I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy  but one quest at a time  So what's the plan ?
label1 Oh  you are killing me 
label1 What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda ? A recording session I must attend 
label1 Shedding the yoke of my oppressors  you blind  sad little man 
label1 I can see the ranch  Leonard  Oh  it's rustic  it's lovely  I'd take a picture  but people are chasing me  I'm gonna make it  I'm gonna make it  They have Tasers  but they wouldn't dare use Aaaaaaagh !
label1 Do you think they're gonna call the police ?
label1 Oh  I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer  Stormtroopers are really the ones who '
label1 Excuse me  Leonard  they have a sculpture gallery 
label1 Uh  one question about that picture  Can it be with George Lucas ? Ooh  grumpy you are 
label1 Are you still mad at me ?
label1 Before I answer  was he a smoker ? I think you're looking at this all wrong 
label1 Well  not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch  we got in  And no one we know can say that  And for all the times you find me irritating  today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser 
label1 I'll take your word for it  I was too busy trying not to defecate 
label1 That's amazing 
label1 And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle  Although that was right after the Tasing  so who can say for sure ?
label1 It was  And even though we're not allowed back there  they can never take today away from us  Unlike my sense of smell  which hasn't returned since the Tasing  No  I got nothing 
label1 Well  I'll give you three guesses why I'm so irritated 
label1 I guess news travels fast  It's true  a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman  and I wasn't included 
label1 You're just saying that to make me feel better 
label1 Agreed 
label1 Sure  It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and have anything better to do 
label1 You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff 
label1 I was afraid you might bring this up  so I have a work-around  There you go  As far as you're concerned  I'm smiling  Although  I must admit  I'm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant 
label1 You know what ? I used to be a fan of evolution  but I've since evolved  and now I think it's dumb 
label1 Hey  look at that  Even in your example  you're all by yourself 
label1 I can just picture them all right now at Feynman's house  probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time  not discussing Schrodinger  See ? They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that 
label1 It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn't let me in  I hated that so much 
label1 Isn't that a little juvenile ?
label1 Wonderful  I just finished hanging the lights 
label1 Yes  oh  but enter through the side  Batman is a load-bearing blanket 
label1 I know  This isn't the printout  This is my real face 
label1 Roughing it ? Okay  Everything looks so big from down here  This must be how Leonard feels 
label1 Mm-hmm 
label1 Wait  no  We haven't picked a winner 
label1 Well  of course we do  Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library 
label1 Well  wait  What if  just this once  we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later ?
label1 That's a big step 
label1 Very well  I will agree to a family-friendly  G-rated  boy-girl sleepover 
label1 G-rated  with a warning for families with babies and toddlers 
label1 Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas ?
label1 We built a fort 
label1 Well  Leonard  don't you want to see the inside of the fort ?
label1 Oh  come on  I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in 
label1 I want to say no  but it's too glorious  Get in here 
label1 Not there  That's my spot 
label1 Hey  would you like to hear some songs I've rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences ?
label1 Thank you  Do either of you know Beyonc ' ? I'd love her to get behind it 
label1 Excellent 
label1 I'll tell you exactly what you should do  avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm 
label1 I bet that started off as a joke  but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it 
label1 I don't recommend it  You'll be doing it the rest of your life  Anyway  if you're looking for Leonard  he's with Koothrappali 
label1 How nice  Here are some topics that interest me  quantum mechanics  trains  flags 
label1 Oh  sorry  That's not on the list 
label1 Oh  wait  No  How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy 
label1 Hmm  I know exactly what you should do  Unfortunately  I cannot tell you 
label1 I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf  Earlier today  it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people 
label1 No  that train has left the station  Now  we can play this one of two ways  You can say  trains  tell me more  or you can just look at me like that and I'll start 
label1 So  often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks  Now  while commonly known as a cowcatcher  I prefer the more accurate cow exploder 
label1 Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice ?
label1 All right  then  You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information 
label1 Well  Penny  who's smarter  the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice ?
label1 No  it's the wise man  That's why he's called the wise man  You know how I know that ? I'm the wise man 
label1 You didn't let me finish  And also regarding the bat  it has sonar 
label1 I'm sorry  I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark 
label1 Well  well  well  did you hear that  Howard ?
label1 Certainly 
label1 Get together tonight ? Leonard  stop trying to control everything  and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do  Go ahead  Raj 
label1 Tonight works better for me 
label1 Uh  building on that  we should order dinner 
label1 Bah  you didn't say building on  You're out 
label1 You're out  and you're out  I win  Who wants pizza ?
label1 Yeah  I never cared for that  It's advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are 
label1 Oh  don't be offended  You know  of the four of us  you have the most veal-like consistency 
label1 Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project  and then only choosing Leonard 
label1 We looked great 
label1 Yeah  and if he does ask you  go  It's amazing 
label1 Oh  I recommend that  too  That was a magical experience 
label1 Leonard  who's really in charge ? The person in charge  or those who put him in charge ?
label1 No  the guy in charge is in ch why is everyone so bad at these ?
label1 If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on  you're packed 
label1 Aren't you afraid of being blinded ?
label1 At the end of the ceremony  all the students throw those pointy hats in the air  It's all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye 
label1 Fine  I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille 
label1 And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball 
label1 All I see is a black screen  And my own reflection  I look sad 
label1 All right 
label1 It actually says at least ?
label1 Why would they say at least ? Is it ten toggles ? Is it a hundred toggles ? You know ? Is it a thousand toggles ? Ten thousand toggles ? A hundred thousand toggles ?
label1 All right  that seems simple enough  Initiating calibration sequence  One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  Well  I suppose ten is technically at least ten  But they're still getting at least one angry letter 
label1 Initiating rotation sequence  Don't look at me  initiate  What does red and yellow mean ?
label1 Oh  Very well  Re-initiating calibration sequence  One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten eleven  It's a good thing I didn't send that letter 
label1 We did it  Oh  if it's this much fun to rotate  imagine when we fly it 
label1 Oh  no 
label1 Won't that void the warranty ?
label1 You know what they all do  right ?
label1 What about this one ?
label1 Not very 
label1 So  can you get it working ?
label1 I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work 
label1 You can't return it  Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty 
label1 Very impressive  You know  when you're done with that  can you look at this ? It doesn't make smoke anymore 
label1 Mm  Sorry  Ah  maybe it's for the best  I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados 
label1 Oh  look at you  the little engineer that could 
label1 You call tech support 
label1 That's what my train used to do 
label1 It is awful  isn't it ? Listen to that noise 
label1 Then who is ?
label1 Initiate landing sequence  Initiate landing sequence  Hey  the camera's working  Oh  look  it's me 
label1 Yes  it's a robot uprising  Call the police 
label1 Don't worry  everyone in here is safe 
label1 Well  my mother's been there for every honour I've won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy  How does this look ?
label1 You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day 
label1 Maybe they'll be best friends  One of them is brilliant  one is sweet and simple  Sound familiar ?
label1 Oh  it's quite straightforward  actually  It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid 
label1 What did they feed the lions  Mother ?
label1 Listen  Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science  Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she's here ?
label1 Of course not  I love you  I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe  do and say 
label1 Oh  thank you 
label1 Doctor Hofstadter  I want you to meet my mother  Mary 
label1 Beverly  would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis ?
label1 Ooh  good question  Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper  boy genius 
label1 Tell her about the uranium  Tell her about the uranium 
label1 But I wasn't  ' Cause I didn't have any friends 
label1 I was a handful 
label1 Oh  and here's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree 
label1 Well  I had just begun puberty  It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life 
label1 Oh  true  But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen 
label1 Oh  no  not at all  No  we  uh  found a place online that  uh  repurposes diamond drill bits 
label1 Did I misspeak about the ring ?
label1 Well  now I have to correct you  As a bit of an elephant seal buff  the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup  So I believe the term you're looking for is a double mother suckler 
label1 Okay  well  now that we have the terminology straightened out  How dare you 
label1 It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you 
label1 Oh  it's all right  She'll forgive you  She has to or she goes to hell 
label1 Well  you doled out affection as a reward for achievement  a proven way to raise a child  Or train a rat 
label1 I'd feign modesty at this point  but who would believe me ? Still  you need to consider how successful Leonard's brother and sister are 
label1 Perhaps  But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted  so who cares ?
label1 I taught her that 
label1 Well  one of the things 
label1 Yes  I thought  I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show  I know  I'll ask Amy  Anyway 
label1 You're right  you did kind of kill the mood 
label1 Excuse me  Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn't a decision to take lightly  I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here 
label1 Irony's not really my strong suit  But I have been getting better with sarcasm  if you want to give that a try 
label1 Whenever you're ready 
label1 Oh  good  You're here  I need your assistance 
label1 What happened ?
label1 Been there 
label1 Amy's mad at me  and I'm not clear why 
label1 Well  I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series 
label1 Baffling  right ? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers  I stopped so I could ask the question  Next thing I know  good-bye  kissy face  Hello  yelly face 
label1 Oh  no  not just a season  If I'm in  I'm in for the whole run  even if the quality declines 
label1 Yeah  Exactly  You know  I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly  fly 
label1 Oh  not just date night  our fifth anniversary 
label1 If that happens  don't make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can 
label1 No  and I'm confused  It's been nearly 24 hours  Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now 
label1 Too slow ?
label1 But you've been engaged for over a year now  and you don't even have a wedding date 
label1 Okay  If you say so 
label1 Yeah  shut up  Sheldon 
label1 Things are good right now 
label1 Outdoor ? Oh  I can RSVP no right now 
label1 Seriously ? Airborne worms ?
label1 You still didn't pick a date 
label1 I'm sorry I've upset you  I shouldn't have asked so many questions 
label1 Well  look at that  even when I'm causing problems  I make the world a better place  Hey  next  why don't we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny's love of the ol glug-glug ?
label1 Ah  well  very well  So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date ?
label1 So you're never getting married ? It's his whining  isn't it ?
label1 It's amusing that he doesn't hear it 
label1 My aunt and uncle were married 63 years  Towards the end  it was like watching cheese melt 
label1 After all these years  I'm really happy for the two of you 
label1 Now get out of my spot 
label1 Hello  Listen  I've been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be  and I think '
label1 Strongly disagree  Go on 
label1 Well  Gollum  you're an expert on rings  What do I do with this one ?
label1 Leonard  have you gotten married yet ?
label1 Good  Don't do it 
label1 Some important new information has come to light  Women are the worst  I thought it was paper cuts  but I was wrong  No piece of paper ever cut me this deep 
label1 Amy has ended our relationship 
label1 Is Penny crying ?
label1 Yes  If I ever talk about going out with a girl again  roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things 
label1 Why did I just hear Amy's name ?
label1 Did she say anything about me ? Never mind  I don't care  Well  if you care  you can find out and tell me  Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care 
label1 Amy's upset ? Is it about me ?
label1 Your marriage is causing her pain ? Yeah  great  I take it back  Go ahead and do it  Yay for love 
label1 The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours  I made you watch that  you said it was an eternity 
label1 Boy  I'm glad we're going out again 
label1 And who's this guy you're taking ?
label1 Oh  you're going to a wedding alone ? That's sad 
label1 Your friends ? Well  I think you mean my friends  And why wasn't I invited to this ?
label1 We make everyone feel awkward  That's our thing 
label1 I didn't want to come in  I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable  So I'll just stay out here and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom 
label1 Raj  you're probably wondering why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another 
label1 Well  you should know that she recently broke up with me 
label1 You hear that ? Raj is devastated 
label1 I see what's happening  Sides are forming  Well  if Bernadette's on Amy's team  I pick Howard 
label1 Fine  I guess I'm stuck with Raj 
label1 Well  you should think fast  because men can sire offspring their entire lives  but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date 
label1 Will someone take me home ?
label1 I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers  Unless you're open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head 
label1 She broke up with me 
label1 No  I'll be okay  But I think that I'd like to send the ring back to you 
label1 It's over for me  I'm done with women  Like when I swore off Pop Rocks  They both hurt you on purpose 
label1 Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan ?
label1 Then no  thank you 
label1 Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute ?
label1 Wow  Well  marriage must agree with you  Well  you are just glowing 
label1 Well  whatever it is  it agrees with you 
label1 Yeah  I know  Turns out  being sweet isn't enough to keep a girl these days  I blame Madonna 
label1 Well  I'm sorry about Leonard  Thought I raised him better than that 
label1 He does ? Who is it ?
label1 Oh  you don't need to worry about her  She's brilliant and attractive  She can do way better
label1 Wait a minute  I know this may sound far fetched  but I'm on the market now  You know  if I dated Mandy  that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson 
label1 Oh  you're right  I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard 
label1 Yeah  I know  Forever  Who would have believed these things would happen to us ?
label1 Hang on  You knew that she was going to end it with me ? Did you try and stop her ?
label1 Do what makes her happy ? She plays the harp and her car is paid for  How much happier can she be ?
label1 I see  Well  I think I'll be going 
label1 No  no  no  no  We are done here  Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me ?
label1 Thank you  And slam it hard  because I am pretty steamed 
label1 Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women ?
label1 And you know why ? ' Cause you're a man  The champagne of genders 
label1 Yeah  well  and you admit it  like a man  All you hear women say is  I'll just have a salad  You know ? Where's my lip gloss ? I think this element should be called radium  That last one was Madame Curie 
label1 You know what ? She was kind of an honorary man  She had a penis made of science 
label1 Why are you up ?
label1 Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light  In one day  you've managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve 
label1 Me neither  But I just had a tickle in my throat  not profound marital problems 
label1 Glad you asked  As I see it  there's a simple solution  Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman  It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship  you should find another man and dally with him  And by dally  I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action 
label1 I'm currently single 
label1 I will tell you what is happening  I am saving my best friend's marriage 
label1 I understand we're no longer a couple  but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together 
label1 Great  See you in about half an hour 
label1 Why not ?
label1 You must be thinking about Donny and Marie  ' cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher 
label1 Well  if you want to see less of me  maybe we should go out again 
label1 I'm here to return your belongings  That's what people who've broken up do 
label1 Wait  Don't you want to go through it to make sure I haven't forgotten anything ?
label1 You wore it the night we went ice-skating  Remember ?
label1 We made one heck of a team  huh ?
label1 It's not yours ? Oh  my  How embarrassing for both of us 
label1 Hey  you broke up with me  It is none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough 
label1 Oh  of course  Wouldn't want to intrude  This is yours 
label1 Now  forgive me for eavesdropping  but as I see it  there's a simple solution 
label1 Bring Penny to meet Mandy 
label1 And we learned that you don't need an eyeball to do that 
label1 Yes  And that's coming from me 
label1 In Leonard ? Oh  even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely 
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents : Fun With Flags  You may notice that I'm holding a remote control  That's because my cameraperson and co-host  Dr  Amy Farrah Fowler  has chosen to end her relationship with me  I'm going to pause here to let that sink in  Okay  If you need to pause a little longer  just click the pause button  But the show must go on  And thankfully  all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand  Anyway  let's not spend any more time talking about her  We're here to talk about flags  Tonight's theme  flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible 
label1 But enough about the Czech Republic  Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't  And yet Romania gets dumped  I'll pause here while you mull that one over  I know  right ?
label1 I don't know why you're so surprised  I watch movies  I see what people do 
label1 Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco 
label1 Yeah  there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars  We're gonna have so much fun 
label1 You saw through that one  did you ?
label1 She watched it  I'm gonna get that girl back 
label1 She was listening through the door  She wants me 
label1 Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars ?
label1 Well  that was fun  Good for you  Leonard 
label1 Well  I'd hardly call this kidnapping  Where's the blindfold ? Where's the duct tape ? Where's the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone  but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I'm getting too old for this crud ?
label1 You're seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend ?
label1 Oh  and how do you think you're going to get me to do that ?
label1 It runs on syphilis ?
label1 Yeah  and talked about physics with them 
label1 Leonard  don't be fooled  I'm from Texas  Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico 
label1 Uh  mariachi bands  wild dogs  beans that jump around ' cause there's a worm inside 
label1 Viva la Imodium  Ay-ay-ay 
label1 Uh-oh  According to this Mexican customs website  visitors may not bring more than five laser discs  20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes 
label1 How can you be sure ? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van  For all we know  there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos 
label1 Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations ?
label1 It is extraordinary 
label1 I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans  However  even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing 
label1 What was that ?
label1 What if it's banditos shooting at us ? What if we get kidnapped ? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pi'atas for the rest of our lives ?
label1 Leonard ?
label1 I am getting too old for this crud 
label1 If I see one scorpion  I am getting on someone's shoulders and never coming down 
label1 Right  Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it  and I shall move the world 
label1 Everybody hold on  Let's take this problem one step at a time  First  we need to decide whether we're calling it leever or lehver  And the sooner we decide it's leever  the sooner we can roll up our sleeves  not slehves  and get to work 
label1 Ooh  the Green Lantern's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it 
label1 Oh  please  the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper 
label1 Yes  we could use science  But it's your bachelor party  Lighten up 
label1 What if that burning food attracts animals ?
label1 We do ?
label1 What is that awful smell ?
label1 What an innovative solution  Perhaps I don't give your MIT education enough credit 
label1 All right  this rust  combined with the aluminium recovered from the van  is now thermite 
label1 We blew up Feynman's van 
label1 What a wonderful day  thank you 
label1 Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store ? It's like I died and went to the post-mortem  neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven 
label1 Age is a state of mind  Leonard  In here I'm 90  Why are you taking your bins over there ?
label1 What's wrong with your closet ?
label1 So that's all this day was ? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news ?
label1 You know what they don't sell at The Container Store ? Something large enough to contain my disappointment  Although  if anyone did  it would be them 
label1 Thank you for letting me come speak with you 
label1 As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained  I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement 
label1 Yeah  I know  top ten  pretty exciting 
label1 Well  in addition to Amy leaving me  Leonard's moving in with Penny  It's difficult not to feel abandoned 
label1 Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard  Someone I can rub in his face  Chris Pratt's all the rage right now  I wonder how he'd feel about taking the smaller bedroom 
label1 Gandalf  but he's a smoker 
label1 Just a few more signatures  and we'll be finished  Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key  Okay  As my future neighbour  I'd like you to have a key  Initial here to acknowledge you received it 
label1 Well  it's not like I'm never going to see you two again  Which brings us to article 23 subsection C  please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion 
label1 Let me help you  L  E  O  N 
label1 I appreciate your interest in the apartment  I just need to ask you a few standard questions 
label1 It says here you're a chemist  Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches ?
label1 Looks like argon's not the only one with an attitude problem 
label1 In general  would you say that you smell better  worse or the same as you do right now ?
label1 I was going to ask you what is the best fruit  but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm  but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go ?
label1 You're healthy  You have a job in the sciences  I've got to say  if this credit report comes back good  you're the frontrunner 
label1 I suppose  What happened to me  Amy ? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings  I'd say it was a happier time  but I was disengaged from my feelings  so who can tell ?
label1 They didn't used to be  You and Leonard and Penny  you all poisoned me with emotions  I was like the Tin Man  perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart 
label1 Fine  then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy 
label1 No  just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional  And since it is 2003  I don't know who you are  so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone 
label1 Hello  2003 
label1 As the kids are saying today  talk to the hand 
label1 They are in 2003 
label1 How can you say that ? Amy's gone  and you two are married now  so it's only a matter of time before you're gone  too 
label1 No  I do  Eventually you'll want more space  and you'll move into a house  and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week  it'll only be a couple of times a month  and then it'll only be on special occasions  like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz  Or  or  or like when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body  Or Amy's wedding  where she's marrying someone better than me 
label1 But mostly here 
label1 All right  great  Just give me one minute  and I'll get started on a new roommate agreement  Yeah  nothing from Pratt  we're good 
label1 According to a recent study  simply thinking about exercise  even while sitting still  can have physical benefits  For all you know  I could be exercising right now 
label1 Nah  I'll do it tomorrow 
label1 Had me at flag  lost me at football 
label1 No throwing  no catching  no running 
label1 Or worse  up 
label1 Ah  touch ' 
label1 Technically  swashbuckler is a combination of two terms  Swash referring to the sound of the sword  Swash  And then buckler meaning a small shield  which you don't have 
label1 We're not afraid of physical activity 
label1 Oh  dear 
label1 Right  Always right 
label1 Excuse me  Barry ?
label1 When can I stab one of my friends ?
label1 Uh  yes  I'm aware  But if I say I want to touch one of my friends  I'll get called into Human Resources 
label1 My last physical 
label1 Ah  this is fun 
label1 Not that it's any of your business  but she broke up with me 
label1 Good to know ? What's that supposed to mean ?
label1 Well  that's unacceptable 
label1 Yeah  but he's dumb  and his face is dumb 
label1 You really think so ?
label1 How dare you 
label1 Barry  a word ?
label1 If you intend to pursue Amy  you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it 
label1 By challenging you to a duel 
label1 That is why the duel will take place at high noon  three years from today  If you're worth your salt as an instructor  I should be ready by then  Yeah  and be warned  I'm going to touch you all over 
label1 Look at this blister  Like it or not  we're athletes now  Besides  a bar is where I belong  I'm having female problems 
label1 That's ridiculous 
label1 True  but Penny's married  and so is Bernadette  And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin  which really rubs up against my clown phobia 
label1 There's that prostate doctor  but I'm still mad at her  Oh  there's a woman  I'll make her my girlfriend 
label1 You're forgetting something  Ladies love jocks 
label1 Excuse me  I'm recovering from a recent breakup  and I'm told asking out another woman might make me feel better  And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu  I choose you 
label1 Well  we gave it a shot  How about you ?
label1 I smell funny  I taste salty 
label1 And kind of delicious  I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me 
label1 You don't have to leave 
label1 I'm doing all right  I tried fencing today 
label1 Okay  But don't get too attached to him  in two years  364 days  he's a dead man 
label1 Interesting  I asked two women out today  and they both said no 
label1 I've been told it's a good way to move on 
label1 Thanks  And I taste good too 
label1 Leonard  I've got terrible news 
label1 Before I tell you  perhaps I should soften the blow  You're face is pleasingly symmetrical 
label1 A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment 
label1 Perform the experiment immediately 
label1 A month ? What ? Are you kidding me ? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow 
label1 Thank you  Aren't you sweet 
label1 Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today ?
label1 But you won't need much for that 
label1 Not a chance 
label1 He said be honest  so I was honest  Didn't your mother tell you ? It's the best policy  So  what do you say ?
label1 He could've softened the blow 
label1 Leonard  if that Swedish team beats us  I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again  Which is a shame  because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball 
label1 Where does he work ?
label1 How many questions are too many questions ?
label1 Four questions  There answer's four 
label1 What's he say ?
label1 Really ? You know I don't like buying things at night  January 7th  2009  I went to the Ralph's at 11:30 pm to pick up Cracklin Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see ?
label1 That's right  And what did he do ?
label1 Of course I do  I don't want that Swedish team scooping us 
label1 Leonard  wait  This is highly unethical 
label1 Was she helping him with his research ?
label1 Well  but where does he get the helium ?
label1 Uh  but this is violating university code 
label1 Huh  All right  do it  Tell him we're in 
label1 I can't find that quote on the Internet  Did you make that up ?
label1 Aren't you just made of sugar 
label1 Oh  of course  An nondescript  white panel van  You may be familiar with it from the sentence  their bodies were found in a nondescript  white panel van 
label1 I'm Skippy  Skippy Cavanaugh 
label1 Wait  hold on  hold on  How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away ?
label1 Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us  You give us the helium first 
label1 Well  he is  I'm a wedding planner who can't find love himself  It's ironic  but the point is we can't trust you  You're a sketchy character in a parking garage 
label1 Well  I never thought of it like that  Boy  frame of reference will just sneak up on you  won't it ?
label1 Not technically  In chess  a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves  Uh  you have plenty of moves available  You could beat us up and steal the money  You could kill us  you know  Really  you're only limited by your imagination 
label1 Not necessarily  Uh  many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm 
label1 Let me give you an example  Earlier today  I decoded the headers on your e-mail  and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald  From that  I figured out where you live and where you work  Now  to make this a Mexican standoff  I would say something like  uh  you give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities 
label1 Yeah  exactly  See  you're getting it 
label1 Perfect  Now we really are in a Mexican standoff  Is this one of those times where I've won the battle but lost the war ?
label1 I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night 
label1 Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid 
label1 And I'm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can't find love  Although I am currently single  if you know anybody 
label1 Right this way  Uncle Harvey 
label1 I'm trying not to attract attention 
label1 She said buenas noches  What was he supposed to do ?
label1 Well  you can't be sure of that  What if the helium dealer rats us out ? What if Kripke asks where we got it ? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey ?
label1 Well  did you see this sticker ?
label1 It's partially torn off  but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U 
label1 Yeah  but what if it's Property of U  S  Government ? There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo  Texas  If this was stolen from there  we're accessories to a federal crime 
label1 That's true  There's the U  S  Air Force  U  S  Department of Defence  U  S  Navy  you and I are going to jail 
label1 Anyway  if you could just give us our money back  you can have your helium and we'll be on our way 
label1 He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all  we are not built for prison 
label1 You're taking advantage of us ? We clarified nomenclature together 
label1 I don't understand 
label1 Well  it better not be more than a thousand dollars  That's all I've got on me 
label1 Well  the Swedes might beat us  but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison 
label1 It scared me straight  Leonard 
label1 That's preposterous 
label1 I don't like being extorted like this  Especially by him of all people 
label1 Or amongst  if they were feeling whimsically archaic 
label1 Absolutely  But don't be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow 
label1 Listen to this  I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton  Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away  It's about Mr  Spock and his impact on our culture 
label1 Well  they're looking for fans to interview  and Wil thought I'd be good for it 
label1 Absolutely not  Yeah  Penny  you spent some time in front of the camera  Any words of advice ?
label1 This is a documentary about Mr  Spock  I'm sure if there's nudity  it will be tasteful 
label1 Oh  it's nice to meet you  I admire your father's work very much  It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey began in my hero's scrotum 
label1 All right  But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt 
label1 Dr  Sheldon Cooper  theoretical physicist  Caltech 
label1 The first episode of Star Trek : The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven  Uh  Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II  Then my brother came in  sat on my head  and said eat farts  After that day  I was hooked  On Star Trek  not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine 
label1 I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere  the dream of a cold  rational world entirely without human emotion  Spock came from a planet governed only by logic  You know  on Vulcan  when your brother asks  why are you hitting yourself ? the answer is  I'm not  You're moving my arm  To which he says  Fascinating  And then you both watch educational television 
label1 I have many  My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny  That's her over there 
label1 Of course  Excuse me  This will just take a moment 
label1 When there was no more room in the floor safe 
label1 When we got the security camera 
label1 Aquaman  protecting your home since 2012 
label1 Yeah  You don't have to tell me 
label1 Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth  So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA 
label1 No offence  but this is pure 100 % Nimoy  Because of your mother  you're only 50 %  Which isn't bad  but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away 
label1 Wouldn't you like to know ?
label1 All right then  See ? Just my valuables  My passport  uh  my will 
label1 Oh  That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy 
label1 No  no  This has been in my family for generations  Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother's finger and stole it 
label1 No  The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them  It was a happy ending  Well  for my nine-fingered Nana 
label1 No  She broke up with me before I could broach the subject 
label1 No  not at all  No  I'm fine  You know  Amy had reservations about our relationship  so all worked out for the best 
label1 Yes  Oh  for example  three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts  instead of getting angry or vindictive  you know  I got a floor safe 
label1 Oh  certainly  Uh  when I was eight years old  Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground  I asked myself what would Spock do ? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch 
label1 Oh  no  he broke my collarbone  I can still hear it click 
label1 Oh  not at all  As I said  the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion  which I've spent a lifetime mastering 
label1 Excuse me ?
label1 Not true  No  look at me  I had an engagement ring to give a girl  and instead  she rejected me  And am I emotional about that ? No  No  I am sitting here on a couch  talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened  ' Cause I am just like him  all logical  all the time 
label1 Because when I speak at a regular volume  no one seems to believe me that I've put this Amy nonsense behind me 
label1 Better  Did Wil and Adam leave ?
label1 Do you think they're going to put my outburst in the documentary ?
label1 Well  this is ridiculous  Being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything  If I want to resolve this situation  then I need to take action 
label1 I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me  And if she says yes  we can put this behind us and resume our relationship  And if she says no  well  then she can just ponfo miran 
label1 Yeah  right  You can just shut your feelings off  There goes television  lying to us again  We let you raise our children  and this is the thanks we get  Leonard  how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions ?
label1 They'd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television 
label1 Yeah  I am indeed  I have decided  instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy  it is time that I find myself a new female companion 
label1 I realized something  When Amy was in my life  I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her 
label1 No  I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again 
label1 Thank you for coming by  gentlemen 
label1 Well  it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me  Now that I'm looking for my next girlfriend  it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again 
label1 Gentlemen 
label1 All I'm looking for is an educated  intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view  She should be kind  patient  and most important  unable to imagine life without me by ten o'clock tonight 
label1 All right  fine  she doesn't need her own point of view  Now  chop-chop 
label1 Are you sure ? I've heard that on those sites  often when you think you're corresponding with someone  it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person 
label1 Off the top of my head ? Uh  prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains  and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory  and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil 
label1 People compete for jobs and trophies  why not me ?
label1 Oh  we'll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates 
label1 That's it  The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live 
label1 Right now  somewhere  a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use 
label1 And  taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter  love and  best of all  rules 
label1 Golly  she sounds too good to be true 
label1 Well  by that logic  I should be with someone short  dull and needy  eh ? Not to cast aspersions  but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that 
label1 One minute is a long time 
label1 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me  You know  probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes 
label1 Uh-oh  What if it's Jennifer Lawrence ?
label1 Well  that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea 
label1 Oh  fine  I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence 
label1 Sounds like a drama queen  Oh  no  It is Jennifer Lawrence 
label1 All right  Can I help you ?
label1 And just like that  you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie 
label1 I am a bit of a unicorn  Well  you certainly seem like a special lady  uh  but as you know  you missed the deadline  so thanks for playing 
label1 She was late  And she found atomic spectroscopy boring  Well  I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals 
label1 Hey  Good news  everybody  Now that I'm no longer with Amy  I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria  Who wants it ? Well  you realize you won't be going alone  I'll be there the whole time  Providing fish and pilgrim facts  Can you people hear me ?
label1 Well  Howard  what about you ?
label1 Well  I'm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up  and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets 
label1 No  They'd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish  Anyway  I wouldn't want the tickets to go to waste  so take whomever you'd like 
label1 And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish  In case the turkey's dry and you need something juicy 
label1 You don't think that will be awkward ?
label1 Very well  then  I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning 
label1 And there goes my list 
label1 I am  You know  and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends  I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation 
label1 If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable  lists would be on the top of that list  Okay  now  oh  since last we spoke  have you acquired any pets ?
label1 No  Um  since last we spoke  have you planned or gone on any vacations ?
label1 Mm  Your aunt in Modesto ?
label1 Bakersfield  I see  Where has this list been all my life ?
label1 and then the next day was 73 degrees  and the day after that was 72  and then it was 72 again  uh  then it was 74  and that brings us to today  at I'd wear shorts if I had a pair  78 
label1 I don't know if I'd call it discussing  You kind of sat back and let me do all the work  Let's see  what's next on the list  Oh  uh  do you whittle  and if so  what kind of knife do you use 
label1 All right  Well  what should we talk about ?
label1 Very well  I know you've been seeing other men  Have you had coitus with any of them ?
label1 I'm sensing things have gotten awkward 
label1 All right 
label1 Just a few 
label1 Is that regular or honey nut ?
label1 You mixed them  No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door  Do you have any questions for me ?
label1 I believe you  I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here 
label1 You know  for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria  that was really bad 
label1 They gave one to that baby  He wasn't even awake 
label1 Oh  Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented ?
label1 It's called Food  Friend  Fight  One of us chooses three aquatic creatures  and the other one must decide which he would eat  befriend  or battle 
label1 What is that ?
label1 Well  my game is better  ' cause instead of marrying someone  you get to eat them 
label1 I'll start you off easy  Electric eel  pufferfish  shrimp 
label1 Well  I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real  so I can't do that  can I ?
label1 Hey  let's not pull at that thread  Okay  I'll fight SpongeBob  because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other  Um  I'll befriend the seal  because he's trainable  which is the problem I'm having with my current friends  Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish 
label1 I know  It makes its own gravy  it'll slide right down 
label1 How can you miss a game you've never played before  silly ?
label1 Me  too  It's comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends 
label1 Oh  I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off 
label1 Did you have a nice time ?
label1 Well  I can't take all the credit  It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way 
label1 Oh  I thought we were just friends 
label1 Amy  I excel at many things  but getting over you wasn't one of them  I think I need to just be your friend 
label1 Good  Oh  I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus  so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob 
label1 Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness  day two  It's 2:25 a  m   and I feel the urge to urinate  My normal urination time is 7:10 a  m   but here I am  in the middle of the night  struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry  It's only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades  I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is 
label1 Let's see  Hey  I was humming  One point for Hufflepuff  What song is that ?
label1 Well  I'm not everybody  I have an eidetic memory  I should be able to remember what song this is  but I can't  Something's wrong with me 
label1 I was always afraid this day would come  This might be the first step of my descent into madness  where I gradually test the limits of public nudity 
label1 I'll show you 
label1 This is Penny  She is your friend  If she offers you food  it's safe to take it  You probably paid for it  anyway 
label1 Dear Crazy Future Sheldon  this is a thermostat  It controls the temperature of the apartment  The ideal setting is 72 degrees  If you find this too cold  then put on a jacket  A straitjacket  ' cause 72 ' s the best and you're crazy  Now  this is your spot  You're very protective of it  When anyone else tries to sit here  you berate them relentlessly  It sounds mean  but somehow you make it adorable  People are also delighted by your love of pranks  For example  Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee  It wasn't replace it with Folger's crystals  I'll tell you that much 
label1 This is Leonard  He's your best friend in the world 
label1 Sometimes he gets cranky  but you can trust him with your life  And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list 
label1 Oh  no  he's drinking it 
label1 Bah  bam  bum-bum  bah  bum  bum  This song is never going to stop  Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating ?
label1 Well  I shouldn't be surprised  There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness 
label1 Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano  And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans  Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back 
label1 The list extends outside of science  Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock  chess champion Bobby Fischer  Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys 
label1 I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head 
label1 They have beach right in the name  What do you think ?
label1 Of course  I'm already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi I know why the song was in my head 
label1 It's about how she made my life better  Consider the lyrics  I was living like half a man  Then I couldn't love  but now I can  More soul than I ever had  I love the way you soften my life  '
label1 Yes  She's like the dryer sheets of my heart  I have to go 
label1 I don't care  Amy  there was a song I couldn't get out of my head  Eventually  I realized the song was about you  and like that earworm  I can't get you out of my heart  So  what I'm trying to say is  you're my heartworm  The metaphorical kind  not  not the poodle-killing kind 
label1 Good  Because I love you 
label1 Well  I'll let you get back to your date 
label1 All right  this goes against everything I stand for  but desperate times call for desperate measures  Lord  this is Sheldon Cooper  You're good friends with my mom  I know I've spent my life denying that you exist 
label1 Oh  thank you 
label1 Hey  Thursday can't get here soon enough  I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee 
label1 And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up ? I hope you didn't need anything in that case  ' cause it's closed 
label1 But someone might spoil the movie  No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me  Surprise  she's even older  Who saw that coming ?
label1 Arthur  what brings you back ?
label1 In the past  you've come to me when I'm struggling with a dilemma 
label1 Well  my friends are telling me I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie 
label1 So  you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere ?
label1 Yes  But she knows how important Star Wars is to me 
label1 By seeing the movie she'd want me to see ?
label1 You're right 
label1 Where are you going ?
label1 I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you 
label1 See  I  I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night  but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you 
label1 I'll  I'll let you get back to sleep now  Good night 
label1 No  I can't  I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday  Which leads me to the following bit of business  This is my ticket to Star Wars  I don't have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents  I trust you'll give it to someone worthy 
label1 Keep it up  I got nowhere else to be 
label1 For future reference  if I want to watch Mean Girls  I'll stream it on Netflix 
label1 Well  as you know  I'll be celebrating Amy's birthday with her  and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift 
label1 Well  so far  I've come up with three ideas  The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L  A  Philharmonic 
label1 Well  I said a chance  you know  When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's  they make a fuss  I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different 
label1 No  no  no  no  She'd be going alone  Well  if you think I'm afraid of birds  you should see me around sheep 
label1 That I have coitus with her 
label1 Which do you think she'd prefer ? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site  and there's only 8000 tickets left 
label1 Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me  but I'd like to show her how important she is  and it feels like now might be the right time 
label1 Then it's settled  Amy's birthday present will be my genitals 
label1 You're back 
label1 I suppose you're here because I've decided to be physical with my girlfriend  and I've never done that before 
label1 So  can you help me ?
label1 I think they say junk 
label1 This is an important night for us  and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything 
label1 Thank you  Arthur  You are the wisest of the wise 
label1 Oh  sure  Well  you're fun to look at 
label1 Hello  Sorry I'm late  I also got you a balloon  but it floated away  and I chased it for a while 
label1 Okay  Ooh  this is different  hmm ? Candles and music 
label1 It's kind of spooky 
label1 No  no  no  It's your birthday  As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask  I'll be fine 
label1 I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner  If we pick a place east of here  we might find the balloon 
label1 Oh  All right  Um  I should probably tell you something about this gift 
label1 Yes  May I ask you a question before I give it to you ?
label1 Why are we saying give it to you like that ?
label1 I see  Is that all right ? I'm sorry  but this is a litigious society  I'm gonna need verbal consent 
label1 All right  Hello 
label1 Why are you shaking ? Are you cold ?
label1 Neither do I  But we can find out together 
label1 Well  I enjoyed that more than I thought I would 
label1 I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again 
label1 Arthur  What are you doing here ? I  I don't think I need any more advice 
label1 Oh  It was amazing  I  I saw it a few days later  What a movie 
label1 Oh  Uh  uh  she liked it fine  But she doesn't have the history with the franchise I do 
label1 I'm glad to see you made it safely  How's your hotel ?
label1 I know how you feel  The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy  They have the best buys  but having the best buys isn't the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy 
label1 Mm  that's a great question  I like when they're next to a Chipotle 
label1 All right  Enjoy the neurobiology conference 
label1 At a neurobiology conference ? What a mean thing to say 
label1 Aw  you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say 
label1 That sounds awful  Raj ?
label1 That's the one to beat  Leonard ?
label1 Well  then it looks like we have a winner  Congratulations 
label1 Uh  stop selling it  kid  You won 
label1 A doctor ? Well  I hope you're not contagious  I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes 
label1 Sexual insecurity 
label1 Kind of a wuss 
label1 Still hasn't bought milk even though I told him two days ago 
label1 What are you doing ?
label1 Hmm  What are you doing now ?
label1 Oh  I see  How about now ?
label1 Well  I can be helpful  Give me something to do  You know  my father took me to work once  and in ten minutes I figured out who'd been stealing from the cash register  It was my father  Yeah  Dad lost his job  but Mr  Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle 
label1 Yep  I'm on it  Hey  look at that  an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella 
label1 Found one 
label1 But  look  an optical transient 
label1 It wasn't difficult  You know how when you see prime numbers  they appear red  but when they're twin primes  they're pink and smell like gasoline ?
label1 Oh  I guess I'm a special boy  You know  sometimes when a boy is special  he gets a Fudgsicle  Which  by the way  tastes like the speed of light 
label1 Maybe it's a new planet 
label1 Well  as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons  I'll be happy 
label1 Come on  Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist 
label1 That's it ? How common  That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space 
label1 Yeah  me  too  I was stuck for a metaphor 
label1 I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it 
label1 It is kind of cute 
label1 We better choose a name no one can make fun of  Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favours 
label1 That's a great idea  I've got it  We'll call it Cooper 
label1 Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper 
label1 Nah  you're right  that's dumb 
label1 Oh  Leonard  great news  We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together 
label1 Okay  Guess we're gonna talk about you now 
label1 Okay  back to me  I discovered an asteroid  and now I get to name it 
label1 Now  this isn't about us  this is about what's best for the asteroid 
label1 All right  way to go  Cat Poster  You hang in there 
label1 It's perfect  It appears romantic  but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever 
label1 I like it  Yeah  we'll take the A-M from Amy and  uh  the Y from Emily 
label1 Exactly  See how well we work together ?
label1 Good news  You're an asteroid 
label1 Perhaps I should explain  While working with Koothrappali  we discovered an asteroid  and I named it after you 
label1 Well  it took a little negotiating  but I wore him down  Uh  we get the asteroid  and if you and I have children  they all have to be named Rajesh 
label1 Even the girls 
label1 I miss you as well 
label1 I'll be able to return to work tomorrow 
label1 Penny  rub Vicks on my chest 
label1 Oh  sure  grope every other male on the planet  but draw the line with me 
label1 She's a dermatologist 
label1 I asked for chicken noodle  This is chicken and stars  It's killing me 
label1 I never did get that chicken noodle  did I ?
label1 Physically  yes  but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason 
label1 You know how  when you're sick  you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter ?
label1 You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me ?
label1 You know  I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick  When Penny got food poisoning  she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television 
label1 Well  now  well  that's hurtful 
label1 I can consider a place America's urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit 
label1 Oh  fine  Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz 
label1 Well  then Raj and I will '
label1 Very well  Stuart 
label1 Our friends are jerks  and I'm mad at all of them 
label1 Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me ?
label1 You know  I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship 
label1 I can't believe you're not on my side  I was on your side when someone stole your car radio 
label1 I don't know  A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold ?
label1 Fine  if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip 
label1 I have empathy  Watch  Leonard made me soup  and I was mean to him 
label1 Fine  Leonard made me soup  and I was mean to him  Hey  I felt a little something  Let me try again  Leonard made me soup  and I was mean to him  I was mean to him  He must have felt terrible  Oh  now I feel terrible  Neat 
label1 Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to 
label1 Hey  we're both great at this 
label1 Leonard  get ready for an apology  And with the added twist of an M  Night Shyamalan movie  I'm going to mean it 
label1 Hey  if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time  that's not on me  Okay  Here it comes  You tried to take care of me when I was sick  and I was mean to you  There's no excuse for that  And I'm truly sorry 
label1 I want you to know that that is sincere  I do feel bad  I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip 
label1 Terrific  Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come  me to ask are you sure  you to say absolutely  and then me to bring it home with  how could I say no to that face ?
label1 What ? I apologized and I meant it  I know that we don't play this game very often  but you're doing it wrong 
label1 Well  all right  What if I apologize to all of them ?
label1 Challenge accepted  Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour 
label1 My goodness  do you remember comes with apsparagus ?
label1 Howard and Bernadette  you tried to comfort me when I was ill  and I treated you terribly  I'm sorry 
label1 No  no  no  wait  I'm not done  Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's I'm Sorry played on the pan flute 
label1 All right  that's eight hours of practice down the drain  And to memorialise this occasion  here are your commemorative T-shirts 
label1 I'm afraid it can't  The trip is tomorrow  And I have more apologies to make 
label1 Wonderful  would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick ' ?
label1 You brought me my comic books when I wasn't feeling well  That  that was thoughtful  And I was insensitive  I'm sorry 
label1 And I want you to know that I mean it  you know ? This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas 
label1 The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus 
label1 That would be my understanding  On a less painful subject  what size T-shirt do you take ?
label1 And  Emily  I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors  And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that 
label1 Well  I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces '
label1 I believe I can answer that  Uh  like me  Raj is demonstrating empathy  Now  why don't you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt  uh  I hope extra small is okay  For some reason Wolowitz took a medium 
label1 Point of clarification  are you still going on the trip ? Because if not '
label1 No  As a fight  it was excellent  She used harsh language and slammed the door  Although as I say this  that might not have been what you were asking 
label1 That is true  Well  I suppose I should apologize again 
label1 Well  that is fine  because I've decided that I won't be joining you  I've realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves 
label1 Well  I've been on a little trip myself recently  Not to Sin City but to Sincere City  Where instead of genital warts  the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth 
label1 My plan was to jump out at the state line  but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet 
label1 Before you do  please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily 
label1 Emily  as I'm sure you know  I'm considered an odd fellow  But what you don't know is that  while I often say the wrong thing  in my heart I mean well  I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman  you know ? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali 
label1 So  for all the times I've offended you and all the times that I'll offend you in the future  I'm sorry 
label1 Good  Then I'll be leaving now 
label1 Stuart  now 
label1 That's me  Bye  Stuart 
label1 Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up ?
label1 Here's a fun Postal fact  The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction  So  if you broke my right thumb  that's Pasadena city police  But if you broke my left thumb  that's the FBI 
label1 Oh  I got a letter from my Meemaw  Umm  Smell this 
label1 Uh  thank you  Oh  Meemaw got a new set of teeth  Oh  but then she found her old ones  Oh  so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth 
label1 Oh  my goodness  she's coming to visit !
label1 Oh  you are going to love her  She is the kindest  sweetest woman you'll ever meet  Unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden  In that case  you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel 
label1 That's not her  That's not her  That's not her  That's not her  That's not her  That's not her  That's not her  That's not her 
label1 And that's not helpful  You know  I got her an iPhone for Christmas  I'll see where she is 
label1 Uh  for the hundredth time  I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart 
label1 Meemaw  I'm so happy to see you 
label1 No  Oh  no  Now you call her Constance  I call her Meemaw  You have your own Meemaw  It's not my fault she died when you were four 
label1 It isn't  Meemaw  Sorry  Leonard 
label1 Are you comfortable ?
label1 You were so cute  huffin and puffin '  There's Amy  I just know you're gonna hit it off  You both have the same fashion sense  Hello  Come in  say hi to my Meemaw 
label1 Oh  well  you two sit down and get to know each other  I'll get your room ready 
label1 If I did  would I find any ?
label1 A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell  Thank you  Meemaw 
label1 Amy  why don't you look excited ? Well  you get to watch me play with this 
label1 Here you go  Meemaw  I made it just how you like  a lot in a glass 
label1 And I call her Meemaw because  well  just  well  look at her 
label1 How could it ? I never told you  and you never bothered to ask 
label1 Well  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  You have to like each other  Well  we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee's 
label1 But why ? Other than you two fighting  we're having such a good time 
label1 My mother gave it to me  and I had been thinking about giving it to you  but then we broke up 
label1 Oh  I don't think I could do that 
label1 I'm gonna opt out of that one  too 
label1 All right  all right  look  l  let's all  let's remain calm and analyse this situation  Now  I realize that you've only known each other for less than a day  but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced ?
label1 Thank you  I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard 
label1 No  They asked me to leave so they could speak privately 
label1 Yeah  I know  It was quite tense  So here's the million dollar question  uh  who wants to pop over there and get my trains ?
label1 No  I wouldn't 
label1 Meemaw  look  I'm sorry  but I have to defend my girlfriend to you 
label1 Oh  great  now you're gonna get emotional  I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop  I  I know what a challenging man he could be  but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person 
label1 Yeah  well  that is exactly what I've been doing the last five years with this little work in progress 
label1 Thank you 
label1 I just gave you my virginity  woman  Cool your jets 
label1 If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine's Day  Amy and I'll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags  You're welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric 
label1 Not a clue  Raj ?
label1 You know  uh  once I ordered an Uber by accident  I just got in and went somewhere 
label1 Oh  and speaking of Valentine's Day  I haven't forgotten about you tonight 
label1 Well  you've become such an integral part of my life as well as this show  I felt it only right to include your name in the title 
label1 So from now on  this program will be officially known as Dr  Sheldon Cooper and Dr  Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr  Sheldon Cooper's Fun With Flags 
label1 Uh  hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr  Sheldon Cooper '
label1 It's also my gift to you  That was clear  right ? ' Cause you're not getting anything else 
label1 Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time  Uh  uh  yes  I really am a doctor  Uh  yes  she really is my girlfriend 
label1 You know what  that's not a flag question  Next caller 
label1 Yeah  you know what's not normal ? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show  Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag  Yeah  good luck  you crazy Kiwis  we're rooting for you 
label1 I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship  Uh  perhaps even a  a red flag  And speaking of red flags  check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union  Hubba  hubba 
label1 Please  all comments and questions should be flag-related 
label1 Speaking of ending relationships  when British Honduras became Belize  they designed a new flag with a tree on it  and I would like to hang myself from that tree 
label1 And actually  it was three different men 
label1 Well  you know  here is something that might cheer you up  The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants  so you think you got problems 
label1 All right  Nothing about this is fun  No one wants to talk about flags  and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes  so  enjoy your new show  Internet  Dr  Amy Farrah Flower present with 
label1 Fine  If you insist on making me a part of this  yes  I knowledge how painful they can be  However  pain has an evolutionary purpose  It provides information from the environment that  uh  behaviour isn't good for us 
label1 Yes  I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever 
label1 When  when we were apart  I learned how important you are to me  And I realize that when two people are in love  sometimes they '
label1 I stand corrected  Fun 
label1 Congratulations on a successful live show 
label1 Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto ?
label1 I'm glad you asked  Amy  you have a confetto in your nose  No  no  no  no  Other side  There you go 
label1 Oh  I heard about that  Why didn't you discover it ?
label1 Well  you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry 
label1 Oh  no 
label1 Because this changes everything  What about comic book night ? Uh  what about playing games together ? What about our trips to Disneyland ? How can we do those things with a child around ?
label1 Oh  dear lord  Penny's pregnant  too ?
label1 Oh  really ? Okay  well  would a baby have to shave once every 11 days ?
label1 I guess we'll call this a draw 
label1 Not to mention the impact on our social circle  Everything's going to change  Howard won't be able to come over as much 
label1 Oh  but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment  You know  my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom  I have two doctorates  I still had to go in the sink 
label1 All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us ?
label1 And can keep a small portion of their heads dry 
label1 Forget helium  The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug  Reminds me of my daddy's secret don't tell mama juice 
label1 Oh  I'll just take one last sip  Ah 
label1 This place is terrific  Why  why have we never been here before ?
label1 That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus  Where's the bathroom ?
label1 You guys  the bathroom here is amazing  There's people cooking in it 
label1 Oh  wait  I found something 
label1 This video  The baby panda sneezes  and the mama panda gets so scared 
label1 All right  Look  now  this may be the rum talking  but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 11 and 13  the Magnus force issue should be negligible 
label1 And stronger  Who wants to see me beat up the bartender ?
label1 Nah  she's a good kid 
label1 Of course he's right  You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father  That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be 
label1 You're welcome  And if he has twins  we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them 
label1 Wonderful  I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move  If I knew what that meant  I might just do it 
label1 A microphone  a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion  and a captive audience to hear about it ? You bet I am 
label1 You're kidding  What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else's bedroom ?
label1 What is it ?
label1 Oh  I suppose that's a discussion we could have 
label1 Surprise 
label1 Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible  Now  can we please drop this subject and pick a new one ? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew ? You know  the answer  it may surprise you 
label1 Please  look at this porcelain skin  I'm like a human sink 
label1 Oh  that part wasn't so bad  I didn't like them  either  But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends 
label1 When I was six  they told me Batman was coming to my party  I waited by the door for hours  Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window 
label1 I do  but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all ?
label1 I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing 
label1 Well  my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting  three layers  and if there's writing on it  make sure it's not all caps  I don't need my dessert yelling at me 
label1 Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment ?
label1 But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong ?
label1 Oh  Thank you 
label1 No  I just  I got a little light-headed 
label1 No  No  if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window  I suppose I can do this 
label1 Thank you  This is all so thoughtful  Excuse me 
label1 How do you know I'm not using the facilities ?
label1 I don't know  I looked around the room  and I saw all the faces and the presents  and it  it was just too much 
label1 I know that you worked hard to put this together  I'm sorry I'm ruining it 
label1 I don't think I can go back out there 
label1 Based on this pep talk  I'd say you're still doing it 
label1 Hello  everyone  I  I'd like to apologize for my behaviour  I hope it hasn't put a damper on the party  So  please  enjoy yourselves  Oh  this is quickly getting out of hand 
label1 Wolowitz  perfect  Everyone listen to Wolowitz 
label1 Little generic  Keep thinking  We'll circle back  Wil Wheaton  go 
label1 That's how you do it  Wolowitz  Now you see why he's famous and you're not 
label1 And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let's speed this up  A lot of people want to talk 
label1 Oh  Oh  now  you know I hate change  Say it 
label1 Thank you  Bernadette  That was perfect 
label1 Thank you  That  that was wonderful 
label1 Oh  you're singing  Well  I'm sorry 
label1 You know  I used to hate these hugs  Now they're just extremely irritating 
label1 I've never applied for a patent before  I wanted to make a good impression 
label1 That's great 
label1 Get a load of this guy 
label1 I know when I'm beat 
label1 Great  so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists 
label1 To be clear  Leonard is referring to the gyroscope  not the T-shirt and mugs  Oh  now they own the mugs 
label1 I'm fine with that 
label1 It sounds like a  uh  contract might be in order 
label1 But which one of us should be the party who '
label1 So stipulated 
label1 I'll say it looks good  It's in my proprietary font  Shelvetica 
label1 You bet I did 
label1 Excuse me  I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten  Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting  Don't need one now 
label1 Hey  Leonard 
label1 I wonder what they're talking about 
label1 Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation ? ' Cause I did not L-L-see that coming 
label1 Well  I believe I'm treating you generously  That's why I've stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own 
label1 No  I am not saying that  because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that 
label1 Yeah  that  too  And scoot over  Part of your shadow's on my spot 
label1 I'll add it right now  Oh  baby  it's addendum time 
label1 Do you still like cilantro ?
label1 Oh  I've always valued education over money  And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions 
label1 And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer 
label1 What ? I didn't sign it yet 
label1 Uh  can you repeat that ? You're breaking up 
label1 Ah  Yeah  I had to get a little creative because the S  R and M keys on my laptop stopped working 
label1 Oh  but I like this computer 
label1 You're too late 
label1 You got emotional when that lab monkey died 
label1 Great  Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day 
label1 Oh  oh  the guy  Oh  pardon me  I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy  Yeah  tell me  did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port ?
label1 Yeah ? Oh  well  was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado ?
label1 Yeah  well  he does know his stuff 
label1 I suppose I should set this up  Or would you like to rob me of that  too ?
label1 You wouldn't 
label1 Fine  I'm sorry  Thank you for the thoughtful gift  I really do appreciate it  As you know  I had become attached to my old laptop  But I'm sure  in time  that this one will Jeepers creepers  that started up fast 
label1 Look at the 4K resolution  Next time we Skype  I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs 
label1 But you only have two eyes  You got a lot of nostril hairs 
label1 Oh  I am 
label1 Oh  Uh  no  no  no  thank you 
label1 Well  no  I just  I  I don't want to recycle it  And I don't want store credit 
label1 Can we please change the subject ?
label1 I'm not being weird  I  it's hard to explain 
label1 It might be easier to show you 
label1 We'd have to take your car 
label1 And I'm gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement 
label1 Sorry  you're on a need-to-know basis 
label1 No  I meant turn right  and you missed it  Maybe you do need to know 
label1 Just wait 
label1 Just wait 
label1 Just wait  You know what ? Actually  yes  thank you  Welcome to my Fortress of Shame 
label1 I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags 
label1 In here is every clock radio I've ever owned  Calculators  VHS tapes  Yeah  Oh  Sporting equipment 
label1 Well  oh  it's just a  it's a  a golf ball that my brother threw at my head  You can still feel the dent  It's right next to the hockey puck dent 
label1 I used to collect them as a child  The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence  A fact that  when you tell your brother  gets a golf ball thrown at your head 
label1 It ends with dinosaurs  I'm sorry if you think less of me 
label1 Really ? ' Cause every time I come in here  I think less of me 
label1 I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years 
label1 Only you 
label1 What good is having a girlfriend if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her ?
label1 Thank you  I wouldn't even know how to begin 
label1 I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball 
label1 I will always have the dent to remember it by 
label1 Actually  yes  I do 
label1 Thanks 
label1 I'm glad I told you about the storage unit 
label1 Oh  I feel closer to you  too  You know  it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime 
label1 It's nice to get back to nature  Why don't I do this more often ? What a beautiful forest  Hello  little butterfly  What's your Na-oh !
label1 I was enjoying some virtual reality  until you ruined it with your actual face 
label1 Oh  it's car air freshener  I was simulating the smell of the forest 
label1 Well  how would I know ?
label1 Hmm ? Oh  Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness 
label1 You may need this more than I do 
label1 Oh  Do not sneak up on a guy when he's sitting on a log 
label1 Look  I'm sorry  when did you even get here ? I '
label1 Are you trying to manipulate me ?
label1 I'm ready to go 
label1 Thanks 
label1 Once  The battery ran out on my phone  I had to wait for my iPad to turn on 
label1 Okay  Well  shall we check each other for ticks ?
label1 Oh  not our hike  now we have to stay safe and warm 
label1 Eh  most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles  so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it  move on 
label1 Ah  it's basic thermodynamics  I'm sure we can figure that out 
label1 That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion 
label1 Oh  well now  we'll never win  You always play the drinking game 
label1 Hey  now  wait  Have we started ? Do I drink ? What is happening ?
label1 So I drink 
label1 Got it 
label1 I can't believe Penny hasn't 
label1 Well  I'm not proud of it  but I jaywalked 
label1 No  he didn't do anything  So I said  you just saw me jaywalk  why aren't you doing your job ? You know ? May  maybe I should arrest you for  for impersonating a police officer 
label1 Oh  and how 
label1 All right  my turn  Mm  Oh  I know  Never have I ever kept a secret bank account  because I think my wife can't handle money  Did I win ? I feel like I won 
label1 Oh  never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date 
label1 Oh  uh  never have I ever put my foot in the ocean 
label1 Oh  Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator 
label1 I have a question about Batman  Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat  Man-bat is a part man  part bat hybrid  Now  if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime  would he be Man-Batman ?
label1 Well  isn't Man-Man just Man ?
label1 What  why did you get a party sub ?
label1 Well  we're only watching Game of Thrones  A party sub implies it's a party 
label1 Hmm ? Well  it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting  Lucky for you it's tomorrow 
label1 Well  you have to go  It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance 
label1 And yet you get to weigh in  Democracy  it's pretty cool  isn't it ?
label1 Well  we'll just see about that 
label1 He says he's not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow 
label1 Oh  fine  We don't have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don't want to 
label1 Of course  it will require a vote  Unfortunately  my official gavel is in my bedroom  but luckily  I have my travel gavel 
label1 There's a motion on the floor  I'm ridiculous  Do we have a second ? Hmm ? Hmm ? There is no second  The motion is denied  Next time  make sure you have the votes first  That was embarrassing 
label1 Well  I should hope so  Tomorrow's picture day 
label1 You keep talking like that  you're gonna make colour guard 
label1 Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones ?
label1 Oh  I don't know  Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off 
label1 Tonight I'll be watching a show rated M  A   and that stands for mature audiences  buster 
label1 All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting 
label1 Meeting  meeting  bo-beeting  banana-fana  fo-feeting  fee-fi mo-meeting 
label1 Yeah  Amy  just one second  Meeting 
label1 Well  then you don't understand what's happening  See  Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting  This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like 
label1 I love Lisa Simpson 
label1 Wait  You were pretending ?
label1 No  I don't believe you  I could tell 
label1 Hmm  what do you think ?
label1 Gladly 
label1 It's not always because they die  In one case  it's because they've become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time  Yeah  but I won't say who it is  It's Brann 
label1 She did 
label1 I didn't say fun fact  I'm not a monster 
label1 Now it's a fun fact 
label1 Cersei uses her body to manipulate men  Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store 
label1 Fair enough 
label1 Well  the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything  and I was right 
label1 They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones  You're thematically inaccurate  but I applaud your commitment to safety 
label1 I never got to ask my question about Batman 
label1 Personally  I find the notion of external rewards demeaning  I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery 
label1 I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends  but that you don't remember 
label1 Wine again ? Yeah  no  thank you  I like my grapes the old-fashioned way  in a juice box 
label1 I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man 
label1 Well  Bernadette  looks like Saturday night  it's you and me 
label1 Oh  come on  Roller coasters  caffeine  runny eggs  I've been avoiding these things all my life  And now  because you're pregnant  you have to 
label1 Well  little lady  you've heard of party hearty  get ready to party hardly 
label1 You know  it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia 
label1 You  you and I spend a lot of time together  Can there be a little mystery between us ?
label1 I am going to record this for posterity 
label1 Eh  maybe it's your voice  I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post 
label1 Yes  And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves 
label1 Or caffeine  tobacco  sushi  soft cheese  processed meats and jacuzzis  which can all be harmful to an unborn baby 
label1 Oh  no bubble baths either  They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection 
label1 Oh  and no swordfish  king mackerel  shark or tilefish  which are all high in mercury 
label1 Oh  and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings  uh  no-no cat litter boxes  no paint fumes 
label1 Boy  do I love restrictions 
label1 Oh  the bubbles tickle my nose  I'll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it 
label1 Oh  I have quite the evening planned  Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains  and then we'll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast 
label1 You've heard of French toast ?
label1 Cinnamon toast ?
label1 Melba toast ?
label1 You get where I'm going here ?
label1 H-O gauge trains are 1/87 th scale  N gauge are 1/160 th scale  And that brings us to Z gauge  at a  you could easily swallow it  don't ask how I know  1 to 220 
label1 When I was five  I ingested a Z gauge locomotive  I spent the next three days saying  I think I can pass it  I think I can pass it  I think I can pass it 
label1 What an interesting question  When I was a child  life was confusing and chaotic for me  and trains represented order  I could line them up  categorize them  control them  I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't 
label1 Well  other than when they're chugging through your bowels  these things are magic 
label1 And last but not least  this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side  All righty  it's time for Dungeons & Dragons 
label1 You're gonna enjoy this  I designed it especially for you 
label1 Ready ?
label1 I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store  For example  in this world  only the men get pregnant  so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs 
label1 What do you do ?
label1 He wants to see I  D 
label1 The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring  You block it with your shield  Do you attack ?
label1 Three giant red ones and they never blink  It's unsettling 
label1 Good choice  Critical hit  Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain  With its final dying gasp  it says  you have reduced me to a pile of sushi  Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce  It's low sodium  Aaaah 
label1 Using your sword  you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner  You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints  As you happily close your eyes  you recall the incredible evening you've had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been  The end 
label1 Oh  the fun doesn't stop  You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast 
label1 I can understand that  From the moment people realized I was a genius  I've been Sheldon the Genius  Although I've never really wanted a break from that  so I suppose I don't understand  Which is ironic ' cause  you know  genius 
label1 Well  mind you now  that offer's only good until the third trimester  I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot 
label1 Morning 
label1 Of course 
label1 Leonard  friends are like toilet paper  It's good to have extras under the sink 
label1 Taylor Swift 
label1 Yes  Kardashian 
label1 Khloe ?
label1 See  I remembered because if it looks like Kim it's Kim  if it looks kind of like Kim it's Kourtney  and if it looks nothing like Kim it's Khloe 
label1 Oh  well  we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases 
label1 I'm sorry  who is Mike Drop ?
label1 Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport ?
label1 She can cover it in a car ride ? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone 
label1 All right  back to learning 
label1 Oh  easy  Bill Nye the Science Guy 
label1 Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars 
label1 You know the golden rule of line etiquette  No cuts  no buts  no coconuts 
label1 Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con ?
label1 Stuart  what are you doing here ?
label1 I don't understand  You were happy to do this when I hired you  Why  why are you upset with me now ?
label1 Well  I suppose turnabout is fair play 
label1 Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have ?
label1 Oh  well  that's laying it on a little thick 
label1 You would do that ?
label1 You're a good man 
label1 Hello  everyone  Oh  Beverly  good to see you  I'd love to chat  but there's a line that could start moving any minute  so let's do this  Amy ? A proper apology requires three steps  Step one  an admission of wrongdoing  Amy  I was wrong  Step two  a promise never to repeat said action  Amy  that action will never be repeated  and that's a promise  Step three  an earnest request for forgiveness  Amy  I hope you can forgive me  And I hope you do it right now  ' cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs  and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh 
label1 Oh  thanks  you're a peach  Beverly  we'll catch up soon  Bernadette  it was a pleasure as always  Penny  you have spinach in your teeth 
label1 I'm back 
label1 It went well  Yeah  I've learned that if you never say you're sorry  the times you do really puts them on their heels  Uh  Stuart  I relieve you of your line duties 
label1 No  it's not fine  It is a breach of line etiquette 
label1 What if every person in front of us let someone cut ?
label1 What if each of those people let someone cut ?
label1 But then each of those people let someone cut ?
label1 Excuse me 
label1 Uh  uh  I couldn't help but notice that you cut the line 
label1 Well  no  It's not cool  If there were reserved seating  and we all had tickets  that would be fine  But this line is first-come  first-served  Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served  Right here 
label1 You need to go to the back of the line 
label1 Mrs  Wunch in fourth grade  And my slogan was a line that's straight is a line that's great 
label1 What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters ?
label1 They work for SHIELD  which is a sanctioned department of the U  S  Government  Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U  S  Government ?
label1 Excuse me  excuse me  can I please see a show of hands ? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line ?
label1 Well  what a sad state of affairs  That you've all been so ground down by life  you don't even notice when someone disrespects you 
label1 Now  let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps  and stand up for ourselves  And  and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated  but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that  Now  I ask you again  Who here takes issue with this person '
label1 I most certainly did not 
label1 Excuse me  I paid someone to wait in line for me  and then when I arrived  he left  so what you saw  my good woman  was swapsies  not cutsies  Oh  no  no  no  no  wait  I ask you all again  a show of hands  Who here takes issue well  stop moving  he's gonna get in 
label1 No  I could've done more 
label1 Hey  good news  I just got off the phone with my mother  She is coming to the wedding 
label1 Yes  I'm inviting people to our wedding  Yeah  I've already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr  and  now don't get your hopes up  ' cause he's pretty busy  but Erno Rubik 
label1 Seriously ? He invented the Rubik's Cube 
label1 Wu-wu  what ? That's what I called you till I got to know you better 
label1 Well  actually  I '
label1 Yeah  and Leonard's mother's already here 
label1 I don't know what we were worried about  they're getting along great 
label1 Isn't this nice ?
label1 Dr  Hofstadter 
label1 All right  now I'm starting to sense a little tension 
label1 It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp 
label1 Yeah  I do  They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal 
label1 I think it's pretty obvious  They don't want dessert ' cause they filled up on bread 
label1 She's still not answering 
label1 I don't like this at all 
label1 You realize you and I could become brothers 
label1 I hope you're right  ' Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother's wife is weird 
label1 Okay  Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother ?
label1 Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable ?
label1 Very well 
label1 It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example 
label1 Oh  golly  however did he humiliate you ?
label1 Oh  excuse me  that is my mother you're talking about  however accurately 
label1 And turned their phones off 
label1 You know  also  if they did have coitus  we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist 
label1 All right  so less or equally awkward  got it 
label1 So  did you defile my mother or not ?
label1 Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold ?
label1 Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals 
label1 A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa  You're kind of a sucker 
label1 What ? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia ? I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway 
label1 But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents ?
label1 Hang on  hang on  We're smart  we can figure this out  Okay  so : Mary and Beverley can't be together  Uh  Alfred and Beverley can't be together  Leonard and I can't be together  Now  I could be with Alfred but I don't like his face  Oh  here  I've got it 
label1 Great  now I have to start all over 
label1 Well  that's still no reason to rush into anything  I mean  look at us  We took things remarkably slow  You and I  we didn't even hold hands for two years 
label1 Hey  hey  She's mine  take a cold shower  grandpa 
label1 Why do people cry at weddings ?
label1 Speaking of love  STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing 
label1 Yeah  excuse me  I need to say something to someone pretty special  and I just can't wait any longer 
label1 Leonard  you and I have our ups and downs  But I have always considered you my family  Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits  I don't always show it  but you are of great importance to me  Both of you 
label1 Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy 
label1 Yes ma'am 
label1 Well  and you need to drive the car and mind your business 
label1 Look at this  Elon Musk has a theory that we're all just characters in some advanced civilization's video game 
label1 Well  he doesn't say it's a good game 
label1 Oh  what did he say ?
label1 That doesn't sound terrifying 
label1 Gentlemen  I think we are losing sight of the real issue  We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex  Isn't that exciting ?
label1 Not at all  In Star Wars  when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation  harassing civilians  didn't you ever think  hey  that could be me ?
label1 Okay  Howard's on board  What do you think  Leonard ?
label1 We don't need Howard's cousin  No  we have me 
label1 I am not a know-it-all  I'm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they're wrong 
label1 I don't see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property 
label1 Don't sign anything ? That's your advice ? Okay  so  uh  if during this meeting  one of us were to  say  complete an oil painting  you'd recommend that we leave that unsigned ?
label1 That's what you said 
label1 All right  you were on Jeopardy  Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question : Who has been a complete waste of our time ?
label1 You don't need him  I'll represent you 
label1 I don't understand why I can't talk at this meeting 
label1 Okay  Quick question  Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel ?
label1 Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military ?
label1 Fine  Ooh  Can I use text-to-speech software ?
label1 Yeah  we'll do it in two  Hi  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  I'm the actual brains behind this project  Also  engineers aren't real scientists  MIT's a trade school  and the Death Star is from Star Wars  not Star Trek  But otherwise  thank you for your service 
label1 Oh  Leonard's mad at me  so I'm making him lemon bars 
label1 They made me promise I wouldn't talk 
label1 Well  now  see ? You knew what was gonna happen  Why didn't they ? Anyway  now we're committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame  and everyone's upset with me 
label1 Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better ? At least mine was educational 
label1 Look  I'm sorry  Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you 
label1 Why would you do that ?
label1 I never realized this building was classified 
label1 The way you put away those lemon bars  perhaps that's a good thing 
label1 Why ? It clearly doesn't work 
label1 Impressive 
label1 and Sheldon : It knows 
label1 Oh  while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts 
label1 I know  I was there 
label1 How late ?
label1 One o'clock ? I'm not a raccoon 
label1 What ? You have some coffee 
label1 And look how irritable it's making you !
label1 I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work 
label1 Ow  it does hurt 
label1 Oh  that was never happening 
label1 I won't be there 
label1 Huh  what ?
label1 Oh  no  thank you  those have caffeine in them 
label1 I am cool  This is Yoo-hoo  chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin 
label1 The first one's free ? Flash  how do you stay in business ?
label1 Gentlemen  I am ready to work  To quote The Martian  let's science the faeces out of this  That's The Martian the book and The Martian the movie  not Marvin the Martian  Although to quote Marvin the Martian  I claim this planet in the name of Mars 
label1 My head hurts and I'm more tired than ever 
label1 No  I can do this  I just  I just need another energy drink  Oh  no 
label1 I want another one 
label1 That's a craving  That's a sign of chemical dependency 
label1 No  I know  but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure  I mean  crack cocaine  nicotine  Pringles  You know once one pops one just can't stop 
label1 You want to bet ? Oh  great  now I'm addicted to gambling 
label1 Just  please  bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal 
label1 You guys stink 
label1 Yeah  but I do 
label1 With what ?
label1 I thought I didn't have a problem 
label1 Leonard  can I ask you a question ?
label1 Howard  can I ask you a question ?
label1 All right  I'll just toss this out to the room  Um  I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps  Now  I couldn't find a caffeine patch  but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository  You know  the interesting fact about the rectum '
label1 You don't shove them  They come with an easy-glide applicator 
label1 I can't 
label1 No  I can't figure out the math  I've been racking my brain for days  and I've got nothing 
label1 I can't do it  I'm not as smart as I think I am  I'm so sorry  This is all my fault 
label1 But what if we can't ?
label1 He said start with it  not end with it 
label1 The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought 
label1 We  we really appreciate it 
label1 Cohabitation with my girlfriend ? That's a great deal to process 
label1 I don't know  What if living together kills the romance ?
label1 Yeah  but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain ? I mean  she's never even seen me unshaven 
label1 Don't try luring me in with sexy talk 
label1 If you want to lure me in with sexy talk  that's how you do it 
label1 Not yet  How will I learn if I'm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I'm in my own apartment ? Now  if this experiment is going to be valid  I suggest a neutral environment 
label1 Well  ideally  an enclosed  self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico  where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste 
label1 Interesting  If my official residence were across the hall  I wonder if I'd need to knock every time I came over here 
label1 Historically  I don't do well with change 
label1 You're darn right  you wouldn't  No matter where I am  this will always be my spot  Like an embassy in a foreign country  this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom 
label1 Very well  I'm on board 
label1 Well  now  don't be surprised if  like Star Trek  it's cancelled in three 
label1 Oh  Thank you 
label1 Of course  the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys  One pair that was neither dating nor living together  One pair that was dating but not living together  One pair that was living together but not dating  And then  of course  one pair that was living together and dating  Although  with that many Sheldons  it'd be such a party  we'd never get anything done 
label1 Well  you've lived with your significant other for some time  I would like this experiment to go well  Are there any insights you can share ?
label1 How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move ?
label1 You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant 
label1 Oh  excited  concerned  a little scared  All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain 
label1 Okay  Talk 
label1 Wow  no foreplay or anything  just right to it 
label1 You're really okay with that ?
label1 This is such a relief  Honestly  if it didn't get you all worked up  I'd kiss you right now 
label1 Enjoy having the place to yourselves 
label1 It's Penny's bedroom  Plenty of men have gone before 
label1 Oh  Oh  and every other day  check the water level on the avocado pit 
label1 Leonard  please  let me go 
label1 Oh  Bye 
label1 I guess the experiment begins 
label1 Which side of the bed would you prefer ?
label1 No  no  we're living together now  everything's equal  You know ? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling  so I would rather you choose 
label1 No  but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack 
label1 Ah  then again  what are the odds of someone attacking me ?
label1 I suppose that works 
label1 Be grateful I'm still in the room 
label1 Oh  I'm just happy I don't know what this memory foam remembers 
label1 Well  it's funny you should ask  because I was wondering how you'd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall 
label1 Okay  well  I am sorry  I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night  And no offence  but your bottom radiates enough heat  I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it 
label1 What are you doing down there ?
label1 Who are you calling ? Aaargh !
label1 Good morning  See ? I didn't knock  but it's fine  I didn't knock  but it's fine  I didn't knock  but it's fine  So  how is everyone ?
label1 Really ? I slept great 
label1 Well  but what kind of scientists would we be  drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data ?
label1 Wow  I anticipated we'd have problems  but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them 
label1 If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits 
label1 How dare you ?
label1 Well  if you are so protective of the scientific method  perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started 
label1 Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad ?
label1 Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule ?
label1 Oh  look who's in favour of compromise  the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter 
label1 Well I'm open to that 
label1 I think we should see other people 
label1 Well  as a male  I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA  Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature 
label1 Don't blame me  Blame your pal  biology  He's the pervert pulling the strings here 
label1 You know  people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with  but the truth is  Amy is just as challenging 
label1 When we're sleeping  she breathes on me  One night  it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto
label1 She's always complaining about people at work 
label1 Do you know that when I get out of the shower  she eyes me up and down like I'm a piece of meat ?
label1 I know  Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind 
label1 Have you noticed it's always an A-flat ?
label1 Well  see  why can't Amy be that subservient ? She has coitus one time  suddenly she's Gloria Steinem  Anyway  I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women 
label1 Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within  When I see a pretty gal walking down the street  I think  hubba hubba  like any other guy 
label1 No  No  if we both like it  I'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going  aw  no strawberry 
label1 Hmm ? Well  she spends her whole day scooping  One arm's probably bigger than the other 
label1 You are truly wise 
label1 I'd say wise beyond your years  but you're getting up there 
label1 Penny  I am going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone 
label1 I was 13 years old  and on spring break from college 
label1 I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me 
label1 My mother was at bible study  I walked in the house expecting to find it empty  and I heard a sound coming from my parents bedroom  When I opened the door  I saw my father having relations with another woman 
label1 I know  It's also why I never open a door without knocking three times  I mean  the first
label1 We locked eyes  I ran to my room  and we never  ever spoke of it 
label1 Since Amy and I have been living together  we've been bickering like my parents used to 
label1 Yes  I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road 
label1 Well  anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone 
label1 I'm sure you're right  I suppose I should apologize to you  as well 
label1 That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you  Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny 
label1 Amy  you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women  And to prove how serious I am about us  I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level 
label1 Amy Farrah Fowler  will you share this toothbrush holder with me ?
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper 
label1 And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr  Sheldon Cooper and Dr  Amy Farrah Fowler present '
label1 Hit it 
label1 Who haven't learned their place yet 
label1 So  let's roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis 
label1 Buda and Pest united to form Budapest  And that's why Budapest is the Budabest  Now 
label1 Thank you for your services  gentlemen  Now  I'm hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music 
label1 Yeah  we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress 
label1 I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack 
label1 You know  if you'd like  I could call your landlord and complain 
label1 Oh  I don't mind  I'm very good at complaining  If it were an Olympic sport  I'd complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I'd take home the gold 
label1 Is it me  or are you purposely changing the subject ?
label1 I have a feeling you're still doing it  But I find that topic irresistible  so  now  in ancient Mesopotamia  the king referred to the people as his property 
label1 Her behaviour  No  I have the feeling that she's hiding something 
label1 Well  whatever it is  it's troubling me  And I can't eat  I can't sleep  And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements 
label1 I don't understand 
label1 So  she's deceiving me in order to spend more time with me ?
label1 Well  I won't tolerate deception in my relationship  I have no choice but to confront her 
label1 Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone 
label1 It's khoo-vakh 
label1 Are you going to confront Penny ?
label1 Hmm  You know  perhaps instead of confronting them  we should see how far they're willing to spin their tangled webs  Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk 
label1 Excellent  I'm very hungry  Speaking of which  what's going on with your apartment ?
label1 Interesting  Very interesting 
label1 Wait  uh  you saw her apartment ?
label1 jlyajbe '  DaH nep'a Penny ? ( I don't understand  is Penny lying ? )
label1 Why are you speaking English ?
label1 Oh  wait  stop that 
label1 Dayaj'a ( Do you understand them ? )
label1 Qu'vatlh ( Damn it  )
label1 How could you lie to me ?
label1 It's all right 
label1 Despite recent events  I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive 
label1 I'm open to the possibility 
label1 Wuh wuh hold on  excuse me  that's my room 
label1 But that's my room 
label1 But that's my room 
label1 Hey  I get it  Everybody wants to spend more time with me  I'm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants 
label1 Night  If we did continue living together  would it be here ?
label1 Well  I suppose we could find a whole new place  You know  and  technically  we don't even have to stay in Pasadena  We could  we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn't even end in dena 
label1 But what if we move and we don't like it ? What if there's a smoker in the building ? Or pets ? Or there could be mould ? There could be traffic noise  I'm gonna have to learn a whole new bus route  Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby ?
label1 I'm not a child  don't do that 
label1 I need to see it  While I'm gone  don't breathe on my pillow 
label1 Can we just focus on the decision I'm facing ?
label1 Gentlemen  please  this is a significant decision  Now  do Amy and I continue living together ? Or do I move back in with Leonard ?
label1 Apparently  figure this out on my own ' cause you guys are no help at all 
label1 I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey 
label1 What  you're familiar with the reference ?
label1 Exactly 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Really ?
label1 Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian ? Boy  you think you know a guy 
label1 How much will it hurt ?
label1 Eating a whole Altoid ?
label1 No  this is for science  I can be brave for science 
label1 All right  just warn me before you do it 
label1 You tricked me  You didn't say one 
label1 No  but three  two and we're done is incomplete  You know those things bother me  It's like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling '
label1 Thank you  Now yell charge and we can get out of here 
label1 Did it work ? Are they brain cells yet ?
label1 Oh  just let me look  Oh  my goodness  I see quivering black lines  Those must be neurons  oh  they're so thick and beautiful 
label1 I have such a profound sense of creation  I  it's like when I hatched sea monkeys  except that this is from my DNA  so this is like me monkeys 
label1 Yeah  but us monkeys doesn't pop  Oh  oh  oh  oh  wait  we monkeys  there you go  Hey  when can we start running tests on it ?
label1 I understand  She's the mean one  I'm the fun one 
label1 Aw  Yeah  this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20 % faster than any other sample in Amy's lab 
label1 Yeah  I have to say  it is nice to share this experience with someone who's on the same journey  Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste 
label1 Well  I didn't make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it 
label1 Yeah  but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise 
label1 Okay  fine  Let's just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them  Although  we didn't need to have sex with Howard for ours  so we win 
label1 Would you look at that ? The image we gave it was 45 % white noise  and it still managed to reconstruct it 
label1 Yeah  we need to stop for magnets on the way home  this is going right on the fridge 
label1 Oh  I am  And you realize what the next step is ?
label1 Uh  no  We lock that door  lower our underpants a little and make a baby 
label1 Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional  Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind  We'll be able to get into any preschool we want !
label1 Oh  yes  you are  I track your cycle  For the next 36 hours you're as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field 
label1 I don't understand  I thought you'd be thrilled to procreate with me 
label1 Oh  I see what's happening here  You're playing hard to get 
label1 Very well  Oops  how clumsy of me  You know what ? Let me get that  Hey  Where are you going ? I  did you even look at my bottom ?
label1 Well  hello 
label1 Would you care for a brandy ?
label1 Good choice  it's disgusting 
label1 Who's trying to seduce you ? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs 
label1 Anything you'd like to pet ? Not my hair  There's a lot of goop in it 
label1 Amy  come back  I don't know how to open the oysters 
label1 Amy  I didn't want it to come to this  but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate  seductive dance known to man  The flamenco 
label1 You guys are aroused  right ?
label1 Hey  it's not even called the Genius Grant  it's the MacArthur Fellowship  Just like it's not Frankenstein  it's Frankenstein's Monster  Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there  And if anyone's a genius  it's me for the way I brought that full circle 
label1 Oh  good  maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under 
label1 I know how to behave 
label1 Someone call George R  R  Martin  this guy knows how to finish a story 
label1 Some genius  I zinged him with sarcasm  he didn't even notice 
label1 Who listens to the radio any more ?
label1 You used to make those jokes about me  Now everything is Bert  Bert  Bert 
label1 Yeah  well I am angry  And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry  And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel ?
label1 That's a good idea  I guess everyone's having them now 
label1 Fine  You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons 
label1 I admire you  Leonard 
label1 You're happy with who you are  You don't get jealous of other people  Instead of being weighed down by ambition  you just float along like a dead body in a river 
label1 How did you deal with it ?
label1 I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist  I mean  rocks  He studies rocks  If rock is so great  how come paper beats it ? Leonard  I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock 
label1 Perhaps I will  This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions  I will cast you far away  Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it 
label1 Ow  ow  ow  ow  ow  ow  ow  ow '
label1 I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot 
label1 Yeah  but you've got all those things  and no one's lining up to be you 
label1 Uh  do you really think calling me names is helpful ?
label1 Thank you  Penny  You know  I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert's success is not my failure 
label1 And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases 
label1 Top of the afternoon  gentlemen 
label1 Excuse me  I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations 
label1 Bert ? I wanted to let you know that I read your research  and your award is well-deserved 
label1 Really ? I didn't know that 
label1 No  I went to punch the water fountain  slipped in water in front of the water fountain  and hit my head on the water fountain 
label1 Sorry I'm moving slowly 
label1 Oh  no  A plaque ? Nobody wants to see this 
label1 I can't take this any more 
label1 All right  let's do this  Bert ? We need to talk 
label1 Rock  rock  water fountain  I am not proud of this  but I have been envious of your recent success 
label1 No  Now that you know my weakness  I hate you more than ever 
label1 We  hang on  you're my enemy  Now  the enemy of the enemy is my friend  And right now  I'm my own worst enemy  That makes you my friend  Okay  I'm good to go 
label1 You know what ? This isn't gonna work 
label1 Yes  that's right  I have Amy  In the past  you've professed feelings for her  Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don't ?
label1 I didn't punch him  He turned around  and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop  I'm not even sure he knows I did it 
label1 How do you deal with the success of your colleagues ?
label1 I can't  Thank you  Professor Hawking  You are a gift to mankind  There should be statues of you everywhere  You know  the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair  We could swap you right in 
label1 What a wonderful idea  how does this man not have a Nobel ?
label1 Let's take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here 
label1 You know  I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building 
label1 You know  I wonder how she feels about all this artwork 
label1 Yeah  it seems only right that she have it back 
label1 Yeah  there's hooks in the closet  I can hang it right now 
label1 What happened to them ?
label1 You know  Leonard  the more I think about it  there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through  Uh  for example  who gets our beloved sword  Longclaw ?
label1 That seems fair  we did just give you the painting 
label1 Wonderful  Longclaw is mine  And how about you keep our avocado plant ?
label1 Oh  we got a sword and a plant  our apartment's really shaping up 
label1 Oh  Remember when we got this at Comic-Con ?
label1 It's one of a kind 
label1 Well  Leonard  you know  who should keep this ? On the one hand  I love Mr  Spock more than you do  On the other hand  I care more about clocks than you do 
label1 I'll be right across the hall  You'll probably be able to hear it 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Oh  now  what about our 3 - D chess set ?
label1 Well  no  I just didn't think you'd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win  As a kindness  I should probably take all the games 
label1 For a man so good at predicting my moves  how come you stink at 3 - D chess ?
label1 It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing  I skipped kindergarten 
label1 Yeah  take whatever you want 
label1 But you don't even like flags 
label1 But you don't even understand its symbolism 
label1 Come along  Amy  I know when I'm not wanted 
label1 Well  powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut  if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter 
label1 If it's like your 3 - D chess game  then you're out of your length  width and depth  Amy  get the Neosporin  somebody just got burned 
label1 All right  I tried  That should be the title of your autobiography  Ooh  a second-degree burn 
label1 It's a good thing you're cute 
label1 What do you think you're doing ?
label1 This is the level you're stooping to 
label1 So  there are fresh linens on the bed and  oh  well  now  I see you've met Theodore  Theodore  these are your new room mates  Leonard and Penny  They're very honest  but I would not leave cash lying around 
label1 My room is paid up until the end of the month  so I can do with it whatever I please  which includes renting it out for a dollar a night 
label1 Will you keep it down ? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I'm running ?
label1 I'm being awful ? You're the one who went out of your way to hurt me 
label1 Dividing our belongings is difficult 
label1 I have to admit  leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be 
label1 Leonard  I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions 
label1 In fact  I want you to keep the apartment flag  and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals 
label1 I do  And to show you that there are no hard feelings  I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well 
label1 Amy ? Wake up 
label1 This is for you  I was going to wrap it  but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies 
label1 A functional MRI of my brain  I did Sudoku before they took it so I'd be ripped 
label1 And it's not just an MRI  The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you 
label1 We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities 
label1 I didn't put on my come-hither plaid PJ's for nothing 
label1 Wolowitz might hand out cigars  I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish 
label1 It doesn't matter what I want  It's your birthday  you decide 
label1 Well  I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers  and your nose was whistling ever so slightly 
label1 Oh  don't be  You were like a foxy tea kettle 
label1 Very well 
label1 I'm not sure  Earlier tonight  things began organically  and now it's feeling forced  like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels 
label1 Oh  I know  but just  Leonard and Penny think we're doing it  and I don't want to disappoint them 
label1 Because if it did have to do with trains  and you were gonna give '
label1 Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express ?
label1 Who's killing the mood now ?
label1 Can I look yet ?
label1 Yes  you're in trouble  you went to Wizarding World without me 
label1 You know I've been wanting to go 
label1 Oh  you're right  I'm sorry 
label1 Five minutes ? We must be doing it wrong  It took us hours 
label1 She's right  You know  I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me  but I'm not going to ruin her birthday  I'll wait  and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year  Boop 
label1 But if my mom asks  we have bunk beds 
label1 I was not thinking it  Although  now that you point it out  it is undeniable 
label1 Raj  show some compassion  Those are things that we think but don't say 
label1 Oh  speaking of personal growth  I recently tried eating Swiss chard  You know  I didn't swallow it  but Amy said it counted 
label1 It was  Bernadette had her baby  I made it to Wizarding World  and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration  Hankius pankius 
label1 Oh  you know   the lone star state  Hmm  That should be its Yelp rating 
label1 Yeah  It is good to be home  Oh  good lord  is that mistletoe ? Don't you maniacs own a calendar ?
label1 It was fine  Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me  I slept the whole way 
label1 Well  we were on our way to my mother's house '
label1 How did we get in the car ?
label1 Do we have to ? I really don't want to hear the religious lecture 
label1 There's always one  She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend  my brother about his girlfriend  my father about his girlfriend  That one had some un-Christian words in it 
label1 Anyway '
label1 Given that your hands prepared it  isn't that a little self-serving ?
label1 Welcome to Texas 
label1 Oh  wait  wait  shouldn't we just eat ? You know  I mean  God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes 
label1 All right  This is on you  Amy and I are living together in sin  like a couple of New Yorkers  Now  while you scold us  I'm going to get a knife and a fork  Joe may be sloppy  but Sheldon's not 
label1 What ? Wh  where's the judgment ? Wh  where's the fire and brimstone ? Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside ? We're already there 
label1 And what special circumstances are those ?
label1 What  so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life ?
label1 Well  this is highly insulting 
label1 Well  I was in my room  I couldn't hear what they were saying 
label1 Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was 
label1 Yeah  And I don't understand why you're taking her side  By being my girlfriend  she's saying you're a weirdo  too 
label1 Well  first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off  and then we went out 
label1 You're right  I have Leonard and Howard and Raj  Stuart  Penny  Leonard's mom  Bernadette  Wil Wheaton '
label1 I was going chronologically  You're right between Koothrappali's father and Omar  the one-eyed Sparkletts guy 
label1 I knew we should've never mentioned us living together in the first place 
label1 Disagree  We've known about evolution since 1859  she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat  This could have all been avoided if you'd only listened to me 
label1 Why would you do that ?
label1 You managed the situation ?
label1 So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate  and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life 
label1 I have gotten much better at that 
label1 What ? How should I know ? Excited ? Itchy ? Give me the first letter 
label1 How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back ?
label1 Delighted ? What   not if I guessed for a hundred years 
label1 Yeah  Here  I'll catch you up 
label1 How did we get in the car ?
label1 I was acting odd intentionally 
label1 I don't understand what's wrong with socks 
label1 So Bernadette  if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it ?
label1 Hey  how's life with your baby ?
label1 To this day I've never touched Stuart 
label1 Wait  so how does the story end ? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother ?
label1 What ? Is there another twist coming ? Is the baby not theirs at all ?
label1 It says here that up to 80 % of new mothers experience baby blues  And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they're doing a good job  Bernadette  you are doing a good job 
label1 Thank you  Internet  I'm telling you  with the right YouTube video  I can give Howard a vasectomy 
label1 Oh  A small human wreaks havoc on his wife's genitals and he gets time off 
label1 Leonard  i've been meaning to ask you  what size shoe do you wear ?
label1 I'm trying to take more of an interest in other people's lives 
label1 That's small  So  tell me  do you have any plans for the weekend ?
label1 Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes 
label1 Oh  well you know  that is interesting  I wonder what kind of infection you'll come home with  My money's on fungal  They're still having girls night across the hall 
label1 At our age  why don't we call it man's night ?
label1 If you do that  i'll win in eight moves  I'll win in five moves  I'll win in one move 
label1 Hmm  Did you have anything to eat ?
label1 Anything to drink ?
label1 Well  I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here 
label1 Leonard  she might be drunk  All she had was chips 
label1 Amy is free  She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled  Boy  when you take an interest in people  you really uncork a geyser of nonsense 
label1 And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo ?
label1 Yeah  I'll miss you too 
label1 Here  You're sad  so I made you tea 
label1 And it's just the way you like it 
label1 Good Lord  I made you tea  just drink it 
label1 Well  what can we do to cheer you up ?
label1 You want to play Jenga ? Or  uh  Ticket to Ride ? Hearthstone ? What would you be the happiest losing at ?
label1 Wow  and I remember when you loved playing games with me  Maybe Penny isn't the only relationship you're phoning in 
label1 Hmm  Yeah  you're right  It's like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem  You know  I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides  But now I'm just like  eh 
label1 Would you like to play a driving game I invented ?
label1 Never mind  You know  Penny went to this spa to be away from you  Are you sure you should be going there ?
label1 Hello  Amy  It's nice to see you 
label1 And that's how you make effort look effortless 
label1 You know what ? If you'd like  I could whip up a quick relationship agreement  Well  I'm at a spa  I might as well do something relaxing 
label1 Very well  Hey  later we'll check out the minibar  I'll show you how Godzilla gets drunk 
label1 Do they know it's there ? I mean  should I tell somebody ?
label1 Interesting  The world's most boring liquid and the world's most boring vegetable  but you put ' em together and bleugh 
label1 Oh good  you're here  Are you still fighting ? If you get divorced  do I get two Christmas's ?
label1 I get to write a contract ? I say  let's get this party of the first part started 
label1 If you find this draft acceptable  then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed 
label1 I did this for free  let me get a little something 
label1 Oh well  great then  here  you sign here  date here  and Penny  if you could initial here to indicate that you're accepting Leonard in as is condition 
label1 That's not a problem  we can figure this out  What are the reasons women reject Raj ?
label1 Doesn't like games  That's one 
label1 Of course you're fine  Not every member of a species finds a mate  Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin  look at the contributions he made 
label1 So now you think you're better than Isaac Newton ? Oh  no wonder women don't like you 
label1 What ? He said he was fine 
label1 Well  I thought we were having a nice conversation  but it turns out I was being offensive 
label1 We were discussing Raj's recent breakup and apparently  I was insensitive to him 
label1 Don't fall for it  He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin  and suddenly you're the bad guy 
label1 Then why didn't you say that ?
label1 Well  I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind 
label1 Well  it certainly would be easier  You have no idea what it's like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Okay  now you're just showing off 
label1 It could also help me identify my enemies  discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them 
label1 Really ? Uh  little tip : jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha 
label1 You are happy ?
label1 Aw  Somebody's ignoring their tiny needle teeth  but all right 
label1 And you're worried that turkey neck is in your future  What  now  see  now it says you're mad  Make up your mind 
label1 Hey  Leonard  if you're happy and you know it  no need to clap your hands  because I have an emotion detector 
label1 Surprisingly well 
label1 No  wait  uh  hold on  Oh  what  you are  Aren't you sweet ?
label1 Oh  ooh ! And that makes Leonard angry 
label1 What  Leonard  please  I know an angry face when I see it  It's this red frowny guy on my phone 
label1 It's like you're twins 
label1 Well  hey  Now she's angry  too  This thing works like gangbusters 
label1 He's still mad 
label1 You first 
label1 Hey  I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you 
label1 You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn't have feelings 
label1 Gladly  Can we storm out ?
label1 Fine  I'll just give them the finger 
label1 I wish I never tried that device  And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair  but this time I mean it 
label1 It's more than that  It's me  I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people's emotions  but that machine just made it so real 
label1 Yeah  but that's shooting fish in a barrel  You're kind of a sad sack  I'm sorry  I shouldn't have said that  I'm just upset 
label1 I feel the same way about you  Now  put your glasses back on  You look weird 
label1 Oh  it's fine  You needed a suitcase  I wasn't home  you borrowed a suitcase 
label1 Uh  guys  it sounds like you're getting angry again 
label1 Yes  I don't need an emotion machine  I am one 
label1 I did  You know  I'm not even sure how accurate it was  I took it to the train store  it said everyone was sad 
label1 Keep filling this one with babies  She's good 
label1 I'm looking at the math  and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller 
label1 I don't want to go home 
label1 Then what ?
label1 Oh  that was my sixth trip to the bathroom  As long as that's not a urinary tract infection  that's a personal best 
label1 Really ?
label1 Congratulations  The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway  You are at the throttle  You are the engineer  You are running the locomotive  This doesn't happen very often  but here comes a hug  Oh  dear  I have to tinkle again 
label1 No idea  All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day 
label1 Oh  no  It's not just me  No  The railway is four hours from the nearest airport  and guess who gets to drive me 
label1 Oh  oh  And guess where we get to sleep ? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose  Now  the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom  but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose  On the first day  I get to drive a steam engine  Oh  and the second day  a diesel engine  Oh  and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork  they'll let me stay as long as I want  So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives 
label1 Oh  get this  I get to take a test based on a 125 - page manual  I get to learn things like hand signals  Ooh  There's forward  uh  reverse  set the brakes  Are you done yet ? You're missing
label1 Oh  hey  If you knocked  I couldn't hear you  I'm welding this locomotive engine  And if you didn't knock  how about some manners ?
label1 I said to myself  I think I can  I think I can  And then I couldn't  so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later 
label1 Well  I would love to help you  but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine  I don't think I can go back to theory  I'm an engineer now  And  hey  just to be clear  a train engineer  Not that goofy kind you are 
label1 Leonard  in the world of theoretical physics  you never finish  So much is unprovable  But when I was studying that railway guide  it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked  Then it clacked  Then it clicked  then it clacked  click-clack clickety-clack  and here we are  Whoo-whoo 
label1 Well  good for you guys  Look  I have a grease smudge on my hand  and I'm okay with it 
label1 No  thanks  I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump 
label1 Oh  Well  I guess it's fixed 
label1 That's wrong 
label1 Okay  but this is the last time  Nice try  blockheads 
label1 Excuse me  I have a girlfriend  I'm already king of the train store 
label1 Oh  what choice do I have ? You need me  I'm like the crankshaft of this team 
label1 Well  whatever it is  it looks heavy  I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home 
label1 I apologize that it's so warm in here 
label1 I've worked up a bit of a sweat 
label1 May I borrow your water ?
label1 GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours 
label1 There's no way 
label1 Its weight and smoothness  along with the slight concavity of the mirror  means it can spin for a long time 
label1 Kind of busy right now 
label1 You know  deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage 
label1 It's slowing down 
label1 He's not gonna make it 
label1 Oh  I won't  I only eat equilateral triangles  Isosceles  isosceles  oh  scalene  You didn't see that 
label1 If the judge couldn't explain it to me  I don't see how you will 
label1 If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door  you're crazy 
label1 MSN Search  AltaVista  and Ask Jeeves  You ?
label1 Bert  I insist that you join us 
label1 Not at all  Amy ?
label1 Well  I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad 
label1 You want me to look at him and listen to him ?
label1 Although  unlike your date  she actually showed up  Oh  he looks sad again 
label1 No  No  I only told Leonard  Howard  Raj  Kripke  uh  Professor Wu  Professor Klein  and a lunch lady in the cafeteria  How everyone else found out is a mystery to me 
label1 Why aren't you talking to me ?
label1 Oh  Well  now I'm sorry I asked 
label1 What is there to gossip about ? We barely have one 
label1 Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again ? If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me  perhaps we could come up with a signal  That works 
label1 Well  wait  This is our first fight as a couple who live together 
label1 I'm not sure of the protocol  Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch  but of the two of us  you're clearly more sofa-sized 
label1 This isn't fair  You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny 
label1 That lady has a name  I don't know what it is  but one time I accidentally called her mom 
label1 Not exactly the welcome wagon  but I'll take it 
label1 I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed  I call these circles zones of privacy  Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals  This circle contains only me and you  It represents subjects we only share with each other  details of physical intimacy  bathroom habits  Although  as I'm saying it  I may need to add Dr  Fink in here 
label1 No  I was just excited to list him as a friend 
label1 I'm sorry you were embarrassed  And now I understand that some things are just between you and me  and in the event of redness and swelling  Dr  Fink 
label1 That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone 
label1 Of course 
label1 Fine  Two years ago I got my driver's license 
label1 I like being chauffeured around  It makes me feel important 
label1 Thank you  Bert  You're a good man  That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out 
label1 Oh  Oh  I'm sorry  Correction  that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert  she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done  That better ?
label1 All right  well  to sum up  focus on science  keep your nose out of other people's business  and  uh  whoa  for a good time  call Bert 
label1 Well  last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters 
label1 Oh  I know that now  At first  I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps  but it turns out  no  she was genuinely mortified 
label1 Let me put it this way  do you own a barrel and suspenders ?
label1 I'm not wearing this visor to play women's golf 
label1 Well  his rent and car lease are exceedingly high  You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping 
label1 He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt 
label1 What emergency happened at the L  A  Zoo ?
label1 No  absolutely not  You can't afford to hire someone who'll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses  That is a foolish expense  and I forbid it 
label1 You're talking about me  Very funny  Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion 
label1 Very well  Hey  Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday  You can't buy one 
label1 She's gonna hate waiting in line for the panels 
label1 She's gonna hate the panels 
label1 You can always watch the panels online  Oh  boy  we do say that a lot 
label1 Your father may have spoiled you  but I won't  If you want a ticket to Comic-Con  I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself 
label1 I'm gonna go as Dumbledore 
label1 That's probably my fault  She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume 
label1 If I may speak for Comic-Con  we don't want that either 
label1 No  but it's honest  and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship 
label1 I'm always honest with Amy  The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder  and I said  you know  you can call that a beauty mark all you want  When there's hair growing out of it  that's a mole 
label1 I should hope so  When she called me an insensitive jerk  I'd like to think she meant it 
label1 Very well  Prepare for a long night of deceit 
label1 I was talking about Leonard  And if make up is so truthful  why is it called concealer ?
label1 He doesn't really want Penny to go to Comic-Con  He's just doing it to make her happy 
label1 Well  if you haven't noticed  I've been between them for the last ten years 
label1 Are you listening to this ? They deceive each other about everything 
label1 This is an interesting way to stay out of it 
label1 Yeah  well  get this  neither does Penny  that's why she doesn't want to go  You set ' em up  I knock ' em down  good job 
label1 Well  with as much debt as you have  probably not next year either 
label1 When the IRS questions us in separate rooms  we need to have our stories straight 
label1 I'm a big boy  and if I missed one  I'd throw a big-boy tantrum 
label1 Nuts to that  I'm going to Comic-Con 
label1 Not necessarily  I have four months to find some new friends 
label1 That's very kind of you  Stuart  Check back in with me in July 
label1 There's my pretty girlfriend 
label1 What ? Can't a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint ?
label1 Well  maybe what's in my pants will change your mind  It's a list of this year's panelists  It's long  isn't it ?
label1 I know our apartment's small  but I think we can make room 
label1 Wow  I'm starting to think you didn't mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place 
label1 Hi  uh  Penny  this circular is addressed to occupant  but with our apartment switch  it's unclear whether it's yours or mine 
label1 Okay  thanks  Just throw it out  Speaking of occupants  I'm given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room 
label1 What about his dog ?
label1 If real dogs gave me buttons  I'd like them  too  Well  I think it's very nice that you're helping out our friend 
label1 If you're implying that I'd have some problem with him moving into my room  you're wrong  Raj is in a difficult financial situation  and I'm glad that he's making changes to improve it 
label1 I mean  it's unfair ; people just assume I'm going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room 
label1 Well  that's been my room since before I met Leonard  and now someone else is going to be living in it  And that someone else is not me  And you know how I feel about people who aren't me 
label1 Wrong  We were standing outside my room in the hallway 
label1 I realize it's irrational  but with Raj moving in there  I'm feeling a bit replaced 
label1 All set 
label1 A housewarming gift for Raj 
label1 It's nothing like that  I just  I thought about Raj's situation  and I had a change of heart  You know  and regarding your gift  you said surprise me  and  boy  did I  Hello 
label1 Well  I had some of my best ideas in that room  and I'm sure you will  too 
label1 Well  I know this is a difficult time for you  You're losing your apartment  you're in debt  and you just  you must be humiliated 
label1 Oh  good grief  She is such a stickler for citing sources  Those were Amy's words 
label1 I know  I know  good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown  geez 
label1 I thought that was gonna break the other way 
label1 Fine  You took my room  You turned my friends against me  I hope you're happy 
label1 How come he can say it and I can't ?
label1 Well  our friend Raj moved into my old room  and it's brought up a lot of negative feelings for me 
label1 Beverley  you know I hold you in high esteem  Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer  and get to the part where you tell me the answer ?
label1 I have 
label1 I hadn't thought about that 
label1 I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster  Boy  you're good 
label1 Well  then at least hold her still so I can pretend she's stuffed  Raj  I let my emotions get the best of me  and I unfairly took it out on you 
label1 No  I can't take all the credit  I spoke with Leonard's mother  and she made me feel better 
label1 Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy  in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship 
label1 I can't sleep 
label1 Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch 
label1 Yes  I don't care for unconscious thoughts  My brain and I are best friends  It should tell me everything 
label1 What if she's correct ? Doesn't that say something troubling about us ?
label1 That is true  Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse ?
label1 You know what ? I'm proud of us  Yeah  with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj  and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette  we're the only couple of our social group who doesn't need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party 
label1 Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope 
label1 Oh  very well  What have you been working on ? And feel free to honk during the boring parts 
label1 Well  what do you know ? Here I was  waiting to be bored with biology  and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy  Which  unlike my body  is an okay place to tickle 
label1 Yeah  I picked it up without thinking about it  Which raises a neuroscientific question  when did I decide to pick it up ?
label1 Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness  and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics  Now  I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means  so I'll wait 
label1 I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making  and I realized  if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics  we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation 
label1 It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee  It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow 
label1 Yeah  and this one won't stain my teeth purple 
label1 That is a valid point  Perhaps we should establish some ground rules 
label1 All right  let's start right now  Uh  rule number one  no using sexuality to get your way 
label1 Is it ?
label1 Okay  uh  number one  in matters of physics  I have the final say  In matters of neuroscience  you have the final say  Unless I disagree  Oh  here  Number two  when we publish 
label1 I'd write that down  but I can't now  can I ?
label1 Thank you  you are a good citizen  Told you  Go ahead  throw my underwear out the window  Same thing's gonna happen 
label1 Fire away 
label1 Aw  someone drew a penis in it 
label1 I'm sorry  go ahead 
label1 Biology and physics coming together  this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind  Oh  I know what I want my treat to be 
label1 Yes  this is remarkable 
label1 By the way  your name can go first 
label1 Yeah  the math is so inelegant  I'm not even sure it makes sense 
label1 Can you stop breathing so loud ? I can hear your nose whistling 
label1 All right  either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races 
label1 No  I can still hear it  Oh  wait  that's me  Never mind  it's fine 
label1 Oh  that is much better  Yeah  boy  if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose  we'd be in good shape 
label1 Just because I am easily bothered by light  heat  sound  smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I'm sensitive 
label1 That is a daring and insightful solution 
label1 What if the fighting is the reason we're making progress ?
label1 Well  if that's the case  then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture 
label1 It seems we have a choice to make  Abandon all ground rules in the name of science  or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship 
label1 Name calling  that is perfect  Now  when I get to this equation here  really let me have it  You know ? If it helps  I'm not the sharpest dresser 
label1 Excellent  Excellent  And on a related point  you're going down  punk 
label1 I love that one 
label1 Well  I'm not needed at both places at the same time  And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks  such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point 
label1 Gentlemen  I've got Amy up and running  Shall we get to work ?
label1 These are hydration backpacks  For efficiency  whenever I'm thirsty I have access to water  When I'm hungry  I have lentil soup 
label1 Run down the pros and cons of each for me 
label1 Oh  sorry  uh  carrot chunk 
label1 Ah  I'm back  you got me for eight minutes 
label1 The coefficient isn't lambda  it's lambda sub one  And over here  you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states  And lastly  do you have any little soup crackers ?
label1 BRB  That's short for be right back  I'm saving so much time 
label1 The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero  And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup 
label1 You know  I felt the same way about the spork  Uh  solids and liquids handled by one utensil ? That'll never work  Spoiler  works 
label1 Oh  I had an accident at work  I slipped and fell on my soup sack 
label1 Well  we have had some fun  haven't we ?
label1 Hmm ? Oh  I did  It hasn't stopped  I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants 
label1 I'm fine 
label1 Just do your laundry 
label1 Well  perhaps I am a little under the weather  It's nothing a little cold medicine and tea can't fix 
label1 What's going on ? How'd I get here ?
label1 Home from work ? What time is it ?
label1 Well  I remember waking up in the morning  Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest  And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra  I took some cold medicine to I took cold medicine 
label1 At  at the lab ? Why am I naked from the waist down ?
label1 My pants are missing  I don't remember anything  Penny  this is your youth  What do I do ?
label1 Leonard  would you be a lamb ?
label1 Wait  wait  Where's my bag ? My phone and my wallet are in my bag 
label1 Where's my notebook ? My notebook's gone  Oh  no 
label1 What's the big deal ? It's full of classified information about the air force project 
label1 That's it  I'm in breach of my security clearance  I'm going to prison  And you know what happens to people like me in prison  I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor 
label1 I'm trying 
label1 Where ?
label1 I  no  that is preposterous  Maybe 
label1 It's getting clearer 
label1 Uh  no  thank you  We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert 
label1 Um  yes  Howdy  partner  Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts ?
label1 It's called fitting in  By the way  good luck 
label1 Oh  thank goodness 
label1 I swear 
label1 Not to tell anyone 
label1 The top secret military information I'm about to tell you 
label1 We really need to skedaddle  Thank you 
label1 Thank you for making me tea 
label1 Yummy  And warm on my back 
label1 You know exactly what I need 
label1 That's nice  Now in German 
label1 Now Navajo 
label1 All right  we're about to go live  everyone on their A-game  good energy  Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper 
label1 Mind you  when we say behind the flags  we don't literally mean these flags  That's just where we have dinner 
label1 So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start  How  Howard  flashback sounds 
label1 Just roll the clip 
label1 Sure you do  I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag  It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936  and two plucky nations '
label1 Oh  and do you remember what you said ?
label1 And that's exactly what I did  I found a lot of someones 
label1 Bert  you're tying up the line  My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments 
label1 Oh  let's take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get  I'll go first  Okay  here  Uh  Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer  And the policeman says  did you know you were going 85 miles per hour ? And Heisenberg says  darn it  now I don't know where I am 
label1 Oh  hello 
label1 Ah-ah-ah  he's a geologist  and I have more physics jokes 
label1 Yeah  which he rudely announced on my flag show  People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night 
label1 Hold on  We don't know anything about this woman 
label1 Is she a geologist ?
label1 She's younger and far more attractive than he is  They're copying you two 
label1 Bert  Rebecca  I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier 
label1 See ? It was fine  I didn't need a time-out 
label1 You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did 
label1 What'd you do  delete your photo ?
label1 Aw  man 
label1 Your first date ? Did you even measure her walls ?
label1 Who's ready to laugh ?
label1 That's a good one  Okay  now  Leonard  you tell a joke 
label1 Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective  Get this  people are calling it the longest one yet 
label1 You and Leonard don't have anything in common  Maybe you should break up 
label1 Actually  our friendship group is at capacity  But if anybody drops out  you're at the top of the list  Unless it's Raj  in which case  we'll probably get a person of colour 
label1 So he's using his money to attract a mate  Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy ? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny ?
label1 Oh  so many things  Her mind  her kindness  and especially her body 
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper 
label1 Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective  we thought you might like to see how it all came together 
label1 I'm trying to shoot 
label1 What happened to me ? I used to excel at these things 
label1 Well  I don't like it 
label1 No  but it's not just video games  I downloaded the new O  S  for my phone  took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone 
label1 I guess I just need to face it  I'm no longer a wunderkind  Now I just wonder what's for lunch 
label1 I've been thinking about our recent humiliation 
label1 At the hands of those teenagers 
label1 Boy teenagers 
label1 I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality  and I came across an area of research called super-aging 
label1 The theory is that if you really tax your brain  the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous 
label1 Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha  ( I did that when I was eight )
label1 Raj is teaching me to make croissants 
label1 Yes  Yeah  it seemed daunting at first  but then I realized  it's like the chemistry set I had as a kid  Only  when your brother eats this  no one has to call Poison Control 
label1 For the last time  I am not having a tickle fight with you 
label1 You're just using food to mask the fear that you're fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever 
label1 It really doesn't matter  as long as it's challenging 
label1 Howard  I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable  not everyone else 
label1 Okay  I think I got that 
label1 Are you sure ? ' Cause I'm feeling a twinge 
label1 I hurt myself juggling 
label1 Howard said I could borrow it  Bernadette said forever 
label1 What  are you crazy ? I'm on a unicycle 
label1 Wait  I need help getting down 
label1 I'm returning this stuff to Howard 
label1 Oh  I stopped that  it was dumb  Uni  bi  tri  menstrual  all cycles are dumb 
label1 Well  it is  If I wanted to hold three things at once  I'd wear cargo pants 
label1 Are you calling me a quitter ?
label1 This conversation is over 
label1 Thank you 
label1 It's okay  I stopped being upset about that  And no  the irony is not lost on me 
label1 This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40 
label1 So I'm running out of time 
label1 Oh  you have to say that  you're sweet on me 
label1 Hey  I thought you were sweet on me 
label1 I'm doing it  I'm doing it  I'm tall and I'm doing it 
label1 Thank you  No bendy straw  some party 
label1 Yeah  I'll definitely live long enough  Vitamin C 
label1 Who else has access to this room ?
label1 This is disconcerting 
label1 Where did you move it ?
label1 Wait  so you're just going to take all the work we've done for the last year and toss us aside ?
label1 If that's sarcasm  please save it for our enemies 
label1 You know  I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes  It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much  The Air Force did it again  They're erasing our lives 
label1 It's okay  everything's here 
label1 Thank you  Can we just talk about something else ?
label1 Not really  Apparently grief can make one less regular 
label1 No  I sat and I sat  but to no avail 
label1 What's the occasion ?
label1 You're so kind  You know  I don't know how I ever got by without you 
label1 Well  I thought that  too  but I've come to realize  I am completely dependent on you 
label1 Well  there is our quantum cognition experiment  You and I could spend more time on that 
label1 I'm confused  You're always saying that you want to spend more time with me 
label1 Princeton ? A fine institution  The place where Albert Einstein taught  And where Leonard got his PhD  so it may have gone downhill 
label1 Well  that's wonderful  Congratulations 
label1 What is there to talk about ? You have to take it  It's important 
label1 Thank you  but I'll be fine 
label1 Yes  I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend  but I still have a colon full of yesterday's meals to keep me company  Although  thanks to your high fibre breakfast  I'm sure that'll be leaving me  too 
label1 What does it look like ? I'm playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart 
label1 I got the blues  My baby done left me 
label1 Am I ? Yesterday I had an Air Force project  a girlfriend who lived with me  and my good friend Raj right across the hall 
label1 No  but that list was sounding a little thin 
label1 So trick her 
label1 No  but you are  so I got you this as a present 
label1 No  it is  Leonard pointed out to me that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend  so here's some quality luggage 
label1 The salesman said it could survive a plane crash  so perhaps you should fly inside it 
label1 Okay  Oh  and just to be clear  I'm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going 
label1 Well  no  it's just  I'm just warning you  you know  if you find yourself 3000 miles away and craving a hit of this  you know  I can't Skype it to you 
label1 All right  then  Let's go to the bedroom  remove our clothes  fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking 
label1 Or  what if we fold them ?
label1 Of course  Here  here  let me  I've been doing a little research on New Jersey  and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod 
label1 Hmm  yes  Yeah  perhaps I've been harder on them than they deserve 
label1 And don't forget to Skype me when you arrive 
label1 And every morning 
label1 Now of course  my 9am is your noon  so let's avoid the whole good morning  good afternoon minefield  and let's just say hello 
label1 And just remember  I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do 
label1 Oh  and one last thing  If you find yourself working with a male scientist who's as smart as me  as tall as me and has hair like Thor  well  then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately 
label1 How are you settling in ?
label1 Now  I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk  Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate ? They're both shocking 
label1 Well  I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered  I'll tell you that 
label1 I miss you  too 
label1 I'm sorry you had to go through that 
label1 You know you just split an infinitive 
label1 I am  It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem 
label1 I'm going to admonish you 
label1 That's the only kind of admonishing I do 
label1 Gentlemen  You may remember Dr  Nowitzki  She's back at Caltech for her postdoc 
label1 Oh  thanks  Dr  Nowitzki's going to tell me about the work she did at CERN  And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone 
label1 Let's sit somewhere else 
label1 So  tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment 
label1 And get this  I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling  which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain 
label1 Yeah  Raj made the funniest joke  he said  which is the best ladder to use to hang myself ?
label1 Oh  Dr  Nowitzki is a woman 
label1 Many years ago  Back when she was a grad student  She's always been a huge fan of my work  and now she's doing research at Caltech 
label1 Hey  everybody  This is my friend  Dr  Nowitzki 
label1 I was scared  but I told myself it's just a big bathtub  Then I got scared again ' cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub 
label1 Well  I was hiding from a bee  but it still counts 
label1 Yes  we skyped this morning and I'm sure I'll check in with her before I go to sleep 
label1 That is true  She keeps asking how long Amy's going to be gone 
label1 Leonard  your wife is sitting right here  What are you doing ?
label1 She was part of the American team at CERN 
label1 Do you know  I've corresponded with Peter Higgs  Would you like to see some of his letters ?
label1 Oh  fun  Like a play date 
label1 Here you go 
label1 Oh  hello  Amy 
label1 I miss you  too  Hey  this is good timing  Remember that Dr  Nowitzki I told you about ? She's right here 
label1 What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour ?
label1 I must tell you  that seems a little inappropriate  Don't you agree ?
label1 See ? We both think so 
label1 Hey  I hate to break up the party  but Amy says I'm tired and have to go to bed 
label1 Of course 
label1 That was fun  It was like Mario Kart 
label1 What ? Is this about Leonard and Amy ? I don't like it either 
label1 That doesn't make any sense  She knows I have a girlfriend 
label1 That may be true  but Dr  Nowitzki's just a friend  In fact  I wouldn't have even noticed she's a woman if she hadn't worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom 
label1 I already do 
label1 Because there's only one of me  I'm more valuable 
label1 Although  Amy's already taken me out of my package and played with me 
label1 Penny  look  I appreciate your concern  but I don't think that's what's happening 
label1 I think Dr  Nowitzki is a friendly colleague  I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor  And I need to update my r'sum to include swimming as a special skill 
label1 Uh  breakfast yes  lunch no  I did have a cough drop  but that really rides the line between sucking and eating 
label1 How thoughtful  Thank you 
label1 And I with you  Question  are you seeking a romantic relationship with me ?
label1 Well  that would raise a number of problems  We're colleagues  I'm currently in a relation Excuse me a moment 
label2 Agreed  what's your point ?
label2 Excuse me ?
label2 One across is Aegean  eight down is Nabakov  twenty-six across is MCM  fourteen down is ' move your finger ' phylum  which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince  See  Papa Doc's capital idea  that's Port-au-Prince  Haiti 
label2 What  are you kidding ? You're a semi-pro 
label2 Sheldon  this was your idea  A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment 
label2 I'm sure she'll still love him 
label2 Well  what do you want to do ?
label2 I don't know  I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before 
label2 See you 
label2 Not really 
label2 I don't care  Two millimetres ? That doesn't seem right 
label2 Is that why they sent you to boarding school ?
label2 New neighbour ?
label2 Significant improvement over the old neighbour 
label2 We don't mean to interrupt  we live across the hall 
label2 Leonard  Sheldon 
label2 Hi  Well  uh  oh  welcome to the building 
label2 Oh  great 
label2 Great  Well  bye 
label2 Should we have invited her for lunch ?
label2 We already watched the Season Two DVDs 
label2 Well  then that was wrong of us  We need to widen our circle 
label2 Yes  and you've never met one of them 
label2 I'm going to invite her over  We'll have a nice meal and chat 
label2 Well it's not difficult  you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response 
label2 Hi  Again 
label2 Anyway  um  We brought home Indian food  And  um  I know that moving can be stressful  and I find that when I'm undergoing stress  that good food and company can have a comforting effect  Also  curry is a natural laxative  and I don't have to tell you that  uh  a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about 
label2 Uh  yes 
label2 Okay  well  make yourself at home 
label2 You're very welcome 
label2 I have a board  If you like boards  this is my board 
label2 At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out 
label2 In what universe ?
label2 Here we go 
label2 Sheldon  sit !
label2 Well this is nice  We don't have a lot of company over 
label2 Yes  I remember 
label2 I'm sorry 
label2 I said I'm sorry 
label2 Yeah  it's like regular boggle but  in Klingon  That's probably enough about us  tell us about you 
label2 I think what Sheldon's trying to say  is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess 
label2 Wu-uh  do you have some sort of a job ?
label2 Oh  okay  I love cheesecake 
label2 I don't eat it  I just think it's a good idea 
label2 So it's based on your life ?
label2 Well  if that was a movie I would go see it 
label2 Well it sounds wonderful 
label2 No  it's not crazy it's  uh  uh  it's a paradox  And paradoxes are part of nature  think about light  Now if you look at Huygens  light is a wave  as confirmed by the double slit experiments  but then  along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too  Well  I didn't make it worse 
label2 Our shower works 
label2 It's right down the hall 
label2 That's not true  remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode 
label2 Well I'm not trying to have sex with her 
label2 What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me  I'm a male and she's a female ?
label2 I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here  I'm just trying to be a good neighbour 
label2 That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate  However briefly 
label2 It's Darth Vader shampoo 
label2 See what ?
label2 It's just not a good time 
label2 No  And she's not a lady  she's just a new neighbour 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 I'm not anticipating coitus 
label2 : Can we please stop saying coitus ?
label2 Come on  I'll show you the trick with the shower 
label2 Save it for your blog  Howard 
label2 You're welcome  oh  you're going to step right  okay  I'll ' 
label2 The hair products are Sheldon's 
label2 A favour ? Sure  you can ask me a favour  I would do you a favour for you 
label2 Oh  I'll probably say yes 
label2 She asked me to do her a favour  Sheldon 
label2 Which is ?
label2 That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come 
label2 Come on  you know how it is with break-ups 
label2 Wuh  I  I broke up with Joyce Kim 
label2 To mend her broken heart  This situation is much less complicated  There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV  She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him 
label2 No  Sheldon  there's not going to be a scene  There's two of us and one of him 
label2 Hi  I'm Leonard  this is Sheldon 
label2 What did I just '  Uh  we're here to pick up Penny's TV 
label2 We're not going to give up just like that 
label2 Excuse me  if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang 
label2 Come on  we have a combined IQ of 360  we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building 
label2 Just grab the door 
label2 This is it 
label2 Sheldon  I'm so sorry I dragged you through this 
label2 Anyway  I've learned my lesson  She's out of my league  I'm done with her  I've got my work  one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone 
label2 Thank you Sheldon  you're a good friend 
label2 Well  your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory 
label2 No  it was a valid hypothesis 
label2 Really ? Great 
label2 Our babies will be smart and beautiful 
label2 Is Thai food okay with you Penny ?
label2 There you go  Pad Thai  no peanuts 
label2 Uh  I'm not sure  everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up 
label2 Here we go 
label2 Ask him for a napkin  I dare you 
label2 Oh  hi Penny 
label2 They're not going anywhere 
label2 So  you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system 
label2 So  there's gonna be some furniture delivered ?
label2 Yeah  no problem 
label2 Um  if you don't have any other plans  do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon ?
label2 Unless  Superman matches her speed and decelerates 
label2 Excuse me  your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength 
label2 I have 26 hundred comic books in there  I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells 
label2 Okay  her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to
label2 Why not ?
label2 We don't need strength  we're physicists  We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes  Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth  it's just a matter '
label2 Do you have any ideas ?
label2 Easy  easy
label2 What ? Oh  okay  uh  okay  yeah  no problem  just come up here and help me pull and turn 
label2 I'm doing this to be a good neighbour  In any case  there's no way it could lower the odds 
label2 Almost there  almost there  almost there 
label2 You okay ?
label2 So Penny's a little messy 
label2 Well they don't  Hard as it may be for you to believe  most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content 
label2 Come on  we should go 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Sheldon  this is not your home 
label2 What were you doing in his closet ?
label2 Oh  hey Penny  this just arrived  we just brought this up  just now 
label2 Well  we'll get out of your hair 
label2 It's a joke 
label2 Yeah  he didn't tell it right 
label2 Sheldon ?
label2 Sheldon ? Hello ?
label2 Sheldon !
label2 Are you insane  you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean 
label2 Sheldon  we have to get out of here 
label2 That's ridiculous 
label2 O-o-o-oh !
label2 Oh  what the hell 
label2 Morning 
label2 I'm not surprised  A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour's apartment and clean 
label2 You know what  you've convinced me  maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet 
label2 No  I do not have a sarcasm sign 
label2 Penny's up 
label2 How did she know it was us ?
label2 God  this is going to be bad 
label2 Yes  but  only to clean 
label2 I'm very  very sorry 
label2 Oh  yes  we discussed it at length last night 
label2 You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise 
label2 It's fine  You win 
label2 What did she say ? Is she still mad at me ?
label2 Um  here's the thing 
label2 Six two inch dowels 
label2 One package  Phillips head screws 
label2 No  please  we insist  it's the least we can do considering 
label2 And control it how ?
label2 Also inefficient  and might be loud 
label2 Oh  really  show me where we put a drip tray  a sluice and an overflow reservoir ?
label2 Oh  I've got it  How about if we replace panels A  B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium 
label2 Meet back here in an hour ?
label2 Got it 
label2 Don't panic  this is what the last 97 hours have been about 
label2 Stay in formation 
label2 Forget the sword  Sheldon  help Raj 
label2 Dammit man  we're dying here 
label2 The bastard teleported 
label2 No  I can't look at you or your avatar right now 
label2 Excuse me 
label2 Oh  right  right right right right 
label2 Uh  yeah  uh  I just  I got your mail again  here 
label2 Oh no  that's probably not such a good idea  Civil servants have a documented propensity to  you know  snap 
label2 No problem  Bye  Oh  and  bye  bro !
label2 No  I'm fine  Penny's fine  the guy she's kissing is really fine and '
label2 No  I'm not jealous  I'm just a little concerned for her  I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with 
label2 Yeah  He was kinda dreamy 
label2 Well  I'm done with Penny  I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed 
label2 I don't know  Olivia Geiger ?
label2 Look  Howard  if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner  I'm not going to walk into the lab  ask her to strip naked and dance for me 
label2 Lesley I would like to propose an experiment 
label2 Right  Lesley  I would like to propose an experiment 
label2 Pfff  I've done it  about two seconds  26 for minestrone  Anyway  I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay 
label2 I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague / friendship paradigm  with the addition of a date-like component  But we don't need to quibble over terminology 
label2 There is a generally accepted pattern in this area  I would pick you up  take you to a restaurant  then we would see a movie  probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock 
label2 Can you define the parameters of the kiss ?
label2 You proposed the experiment  I think you should present your findings first 
label2 None at all ?
label2 Oh  we tried kissing  but the earth didn't move  I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway 
label2 I know what you're thinking  I've taken your asthma into account  There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos 
label2 I've been thinking about names  I'm kind of torn between Einstein  Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots 
label2 You're right  I didn't ask her out  I should ask her out 
label2 Good afternoon Penny  so hi  hey  Uh ' I was wondering if you had plans for dinner 
label2 There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner  Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed  so  to clarify here  by dinner I mean supper 
label2 Or dinner  I was thinking six thirty  if you can go  or a different time 
label2 Really ? Great !
label2 Us guys ?
label2 Great  Did we say a time ?
label2 And that's still good for you 
label2 I'll get my chisel 
label2 To ' carve the ' okay  I'll see you six thirty 
label2 How do I look ?
label2 Can you tell I'm perspiring a little ?
label2 Six thirty 
label2 Is it too much ?
label2 By the way  if it should ever come up  you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos 
label2 No reason  Oh  you know what  maybe this isn't such a good idea 
label2 You're right  alcohol  poor judgement  it could go well 
label2 You could have stopped at ' it could go well  '
label2 I mean  I'm a perfectly nice guy  There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner  Maybe take a walk afterwards  talk about things we have in common  ' you love pottery ? I love pottery ! ' You know  there's a pause  we both know what's happening  I lean in  we kiss  it's a little tentative at first but then I realise  she's kissing me back  and she's biting my lower lip  you know  she wants me  this thing is going the distance  we're going to have sex ! Oh God ! Oh  my God !
label2 I'm having a panic attack 
label2 If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack  that's why they call it a panic attack 
label2 Oh  who am I kidding  I can't go through with this  you need to call her and cancel 
label2 Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me  but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again 
label2 Give me the phone 
label2 Stop asking me all these questions  I need to take another shower 
label2 You're kidding  well  then  that's something we have in common 
label2 We both have people in our lives who ' want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud 
label2 Nothing 
label2 Well  with the exception of string theory  not much has happened since the 1930 ' s  and you can't prove string theory  at best you can say ' hey  look  my idea has an internal logical consistency  '
label2 What's new at the Cheesecake Factory ?
label2 Good  Good  And what about your  uh  hallway friend 
label2 Ugh  don't get me started on rebound sex 
label2 I'm not sure that I do  Um  is that one thirty-six hour experience  or is it thirty six hours spread out over say  one ' glorious summer 
label2 Well  chafing  right ?
label2 Of course  yeah  emotional chafing  Hey  do you want to see something cool ? ( Penny nods  ) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it 
label2 Physics 
label2 Actually  it's centripetal force  which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive 
label2 Yeah  I'm okay  Did you spill ketchup ?
label2 I'm not okay 
label2 No  no  I'm okay  it's stopped bleeding 
label2 Yes  but I get car sick too  so '
label2 Sorry about your car  by the way 
label2 This ? No  No  of course not  this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up  because of work and a colonoscopy 
label2 When I take a girl out on a date  and I do  she knows she's been dated  Capital D  Bold face  underline  like Day-ted  I think I might have a little concussion  I'm going to go lay down for a while  good night 
label2 Awesome !
label2 Why  did you hit a roadblock with invisibility ?
label2 Interesting 
label2 Sounds like a breakthrough  should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover ?
label2 Then I guess congratulations are in order 
label2 I know  I'm familiar with you 
label2 Yes  I was there 
label2 Mahalo's a nice touch 
label2 Interesting  you should lead with that 
label2 You don't have buffets in India ?
label2 Well  you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts 
label2 You're making eggs for breakfast ?
label2 Huh ? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast 
label2 Sounds yummy  I look forward to your work with bacon 
label2 You know  I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back 
label2 Okay  I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs 
label2 And we all thank you 
label2 What's with the fish ?
label2 What happened to your scrambled egg research ?
label2 So ' fish 
label2 Fish nightlights 
label2 Mum's the word  Sheldon  are you sure you don't want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back 
label2 Like luminous fish 
label2 Right ' I didn't ' 
label2 Thank you for coming on such short notice 
label2 I didn't know what else to do  he's lost all focus  every day he's got a new obsession 
label2 Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes 
label2 Really  when was the last time you left the house 
label2 That was three weeks ago 
label2 Where are you going ?
label2 Sheldon ? Your mum made dinner 
label2 No  we're not  we're not  not a couple  two singles  like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that '  are friends 
label2 Really ? That's impressive 
label2 Hey  how did it go ?
label2 That narrows it down 
label2 No  no  no  no  Orcs are magic  Superman is vulnerable to magic  not to mention  you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk 
label2 And Orcs !
label2 Just get a hamburger  you like hamburgers 
label2 I'm sorry  Give him a hamburger 
label2 Make it two 
label2 Hey Lesley 
label2 Lesley  this is Penny  she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me 
label2 Lesley and I do research together at the University 
label2 What happened to Elliot Wong ?
label2 Yeah  sure  why not 
label2 Why at my place ?
label2 Yeah  my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough 
label2 Lesley ? No  no-oh  what are you kidding ?
label2 Thank you Sheldon 
label2 If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she  Penny  thought that I should her  Lesley  out  indicating that she  Penny  had no interest in me asking her  Penny  out  But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she  Lesley  had turned me down then she  Penny  could be offering consolation  That's too bad  you would have made a cute couple  But while thinking  good  Leonard remains available 
label2 How so ?
label2 Well  what do you think 
label2 Thank you 
label2 That was fun  Lesley  thanks for including me 
label2 Uh  sure  why not 
label2 Really ?
label2 I thought you weren't interested in me 
label2 You mean my cello ?
label2 Penny ? What about her ?
label2 Well  I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast  which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils  so I guess there's no point in bringing it up 
label2 No  No  there's nothing going on between Penny and me 
label2 Yeah  Yeah  I guess I am 
label2 Yeah  yeah it is good  Did you want to start now ?
label2 Oh  Okay  A little musical foreplay  Terrific 
label2 I'm good  I'm good to go 
label2 Are you sure ?
label2 Oh yeah  But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having ?
label2 Oh  hi 
label2 Pretty good 
label2 Pretty  very  there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good  why do you ask ?
label2 Sheldon !
label2 Wuh  I don't '  th-th-th-that's really two different questions  uh  I'm not '  Sheldon  we have to go !
label2 Thank you  What did she mean  she's happy for me ? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone  or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy  because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy  even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy  You know  because the second person  though happy  is now romantically unavailable to the first person 
label2 You know what  I'm being ridiculous  But who cares what Penny thinks  Lesley is a terrific girl  she's attractive  we like each other  she's extremely intelligent 
label2 She fixed your equation 
label2 You don't believe in luck 
label2 Regardless  I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley  I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy 
label2 Hey  Lesley 
label2 Brrrr  Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana 
label2 So anyway
label2 I'm not sure  but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt 
label2 Who wouldn't ?
label2 Yeah  well  I'm just glad to be a part of it  So what happens now ?
label2 Oh  Okay  Thank you 
label2 You want to make plans for New Years 
label2 Doctor what ?
label2 Well  that part's true !
label2 No kidding 
label2 Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted 
label2 Really ?
label2 Oh  to be honest  I don't think it's going to work out 
label2 Well what did she mean by that ? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention ?
label2 Are you even listening to me ?
label2 Okay then  You know  you can grow the ingredients for soup 
label2 Oh  come on  some battles you win  some battles you lose 
label2 Sheldon  let it go 
label2 You hid behind a tree yelling ' get the kid in the yarmulkah  get the kid in the yarmulkah  '
label2 A party ?
label2 Yeah  I don't know  Penny '
label2 We're really more ' 
label2 But thanks  thanks for thinking of us 
label2 Is there a theme ?
label2 He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction  fantasy '
label2 Oh  no 
label2 We all have other costumes  we can change 
label2 Okay  how about this  nobody gets to be The Flash  we all change  agreed ?
label2 You went with Thor ?
label2 Hey  Sheldon  there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party 
label2 No  it's not '
label2 Terrific  Um  this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group  and I need you not to embarrass me tonight 
label2 For example  tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey 
label2 All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group  A potential close friend and ' perhaps more  I don't want to look like a dork 
label2 Hey  sorry we're late 
label2 Actually  Penny  he's Rob '
label2 We're socialising  Meeting new people 
label2 Where do you get this stuff ?
label2 I ' want to get to know Penny's friends  I just  I don't know how to talk to these people 
label2 How so ?
label2 Then what happens ?
label2 This is ridiculous  I'm jumping in 
label2 No  you're coming with me 
label2 Come on 
label2 Yes  But I need a wing-man 
label2 Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra ?
label2 That's Penny's ex-boyfriend 
label2 If he were any bigger  he'd have moons orbiting him 
label2 Why should we leave ? For all we know  he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here 
label2 Maybe they just want to be friends 
label2 Look  if this was 15000 years ago  by virtue of his size and strength  Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners 
label2 Yes  but our society has undergone a paradigm shift  in the information age  Sheldon  you and I are the alpha males  We shouldn't have to back down 
label2 No  I'm going to assert my dominance face to face 
label2 Hello Penny  Hello Kurt 
label2 No  I'm a Hobbit 
label2 Uh  a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth  whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior 
label2 I think we're all talking to Penny here 
label2 No  I said animalistic  Of course we're all animals  but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree 
label2 A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what ?
label2 There's not going to be a confrontation  in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation 
label2 Yeah  no  I'm fine  It's good  it's a good party  thanks for having us  it's just getting a little late so ' 
label2 What's that ?
label2 Good night Sheldon 
label2 I'm fine 
label2 It's not your fault 
label2 So why was he at your party ?
label2 There there 
label2 Nothing  you're perfect 
label2 Yes you are 
label2 How much have you had to drink tonight ?
label2 Yeah  I'm a frickin ' genius 
label2 Because if all guys were like me  the human race couldn't survive 
label2 Probably 
label2 That's right  you saw what you saw  That's how we roll in The Shire 
label2 So ? We'll start now 
label2 Sure  What's going on 
label2 Oh  I don't think she's a whore 
label2 Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half 
label2 Great idea 
label2 It's the only way we can play teams 
label2 Penny  you are on fire 
label2 Well  to be fair  he is also a rather unpleasant winner 
label2 I guess for you that's an option 
label2 Good night 
label2 She's an enigma  Raj 
label2 She's gone  Sheldon 
label2 What's wrong ?
label2 Are you sure ?
label2 No  take the couch  or my bed  I just got new pillows  hypo-allergenics 
label2 Let me guess  you have a problem with this 
label2 It's up to you  crazy person's choice 
label2 Your friendship means a lot to me as well  what else ?
label2 I'm sorry  are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism ?
label2 I'll get you a blanket and a pillow 
label2 Sorry about that 
label2 FYI  his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light 
label2 Well  sleep tight 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Penny's still sleeping 
label2 Almost 6:30 
label2 Leonard 
label2 Penny  you're always welcome to stay with us 
label2 For one thing you live with your mother 
label2 Sheldon you just can't dictate '
label2 Howard  can't you see she's using you ?
label2 I see a problem 
label2 So  we'll just order three entrees 
label2 Can we get an order of dumplings  but with three instead of four 
label2 This isn't a substitution  it's a reduction 
label2 If we have extra  we'll just take the leftovers home 
label2 Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend  if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth 
label2 We don't order egg rolls 
label2 Here's an idea  why don't we just go out for Indian food 
label2 Yeah  we can always divide soup 
label2 Well  with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie 
label2 Right  anyway  uh  with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere  we had something we wanted to ask you  Sheldon ?
label2 Sheldon  remember  we role-played this 
label2 Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend 
label2 Aaah  for God's sake  Sheldon  you are driving me crazy 
label2 No  I'm pretty sure my anger's with you 
label2 Who are you calling ?
label2 Sheldon  think this through  you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo 
label2 You're right  all sex has is nudity  orgasms and human contact 
label2 That will do  Raj  straight for the tank 
label2 No  never mind  alright  go 
label2 Yeah  we're not like Haroun and Tanweer !
label2 Actually  I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programmes in India 
label2 I bet you're right 
label2 I'm not a big fan of musicals  but I love that show 
label2 Well  maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer 
label2 Hey  I thought you were finding new friends 
label2 So don't call her 
label2 So call her 
label2 I'm done  anybody else ?
label2 Look on the bright side  she might turn out to be a nice  beautiful girl 
label2 Oh  hey 
label2 Oh  great  well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition 
label2 Look  Penny  we'd love to help you  but Raj is going through some stuff right now  And besides  he doesn't drink  so '
label2 Thank you  This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container  Thank you 
label2 It's amazing 
label2 Um ' Raj 
label2 Wait a minute  what's the plan here ? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married  what's he going to do  stay drunk for the rest of his life ?
label2 I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita 
label2 We all know the reason  Sheldon  what are you getting at ?
label2 Beats the hell out of me 
label2 Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali  in all fairness  it wasn't entirely Raj's fault 
label2 No  I'm Leonard 
label2 You left with his date  Friends don't do that to each other 
label2 Take it  Raj  It's more than I've ever gotten 
label2 Hold on  What happened with you and Lalita ?
label2 I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren 
label2 I don't believe it  what's gotten into him ?
label2 You didn't ?
label2 Hang on  hang on  do you not realise what we just did 
label2 No  no  no  you don't get it  um  Howard  enable public access 
label2 Wireless webcams  wave hello 
label2 Who's running the red Corvette ?
label2 Sheldon  why is this letter in the trash ?
label2 It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics  They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates 
label2 Okay ' if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question  why did you throw it out 
label2 Are there any other honours I've gotten that I don't know about ? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it ?
label2 Okay  let me put it this way  I'm doing it 
label2 Oh  come on  The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically 
label2 Excuse me  I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis 
label2 So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word ?
label2 Alright  I don't care what you say  I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings 
label2 You forbid it ?
label2 Oh  you admit that it's our work 
label2 Not only is he still not talking to me  but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode  You know  like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners ?
label2 Oh  that's the bottled city of Kandor 
label2 You see  Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton  it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman 
label2 It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it 
label2 Great  be right back 
label2 No  I'm not shy 
label2 I know you won't look  why would you look  there's nothing to see  well  not nothing ' 
label2 No  No  Scientists do not compromise  Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions  Not to mention  Sheldon is batcrap crazy 
label2 Oh  careful  That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit 
label2 Because it's not a costume  it's a flight suit 
label2 Ah  Technically yes  but  if you'll notice  it's reversible  So it works as two 
label2 My last growth spurt 
label2 Okay  I'm leaving for the conference 
label2 Sheldon I didn't mean it like that 
label2 I don't know  I wasn't choosing my '
label2 No  no not at all  A little bit 
label2 Let's go 
label2 You're kidding 
label2 All ? In particle physics  twenty five is Woodstock 
label2 I wasn't expecting such a crowd  I'm a little nervous 
label2 It's a classic  right ?
label2 So  in conclusion  the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero  the moment of inertia changes  and the solid becomes a super-solid  which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter 
label2 I didn't skip it  it's just an anecdote  It's not science 
label2 You are not Isaac Newton 
label2 You cannot possibly be that arrogant 
label2 Really  so why did you come ?
label2 I didn't screw it up 
label2 I've had enough of your condescension  Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you  maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16  but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room  No offense  And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation 
label2 You cannot blow up my head with your mind 
label2 You were trying to blow up my head 
label2 It wasn't  it was not  you are a nutcase 
label2 Stop  stop it  quit it 
label2 You're lucky I didn't run you over 
label2 You're right  I'm the problem  I'm the one that needs help 
label2 Oh jeez  Is this suit really look that bad ?
label2 See  the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet  and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson  but that future no longer exists  due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2 
label2 Skynet is kinky ? I don't know 
label2 Alright  oh wait  they use it to in '
label2 What the hell is that ?
label2 What ? Oh we just had to ' mail some letters and
label2 Oh  I give up 
label2 Believe it or not  personal growth  What happened ?
label2 No you don't  No he doesn't 
label2 Oh  congratulations  what a lucky break 
label2 No you don't  He doesn't 
label2 No  it's this Friday  at eight 
label2 See you 
label2 Sheldon  are you worried about your safety 
label2 That's very true 
label2 It's two o'clock in the morning
label2 I highly doubt that  Go away 
label2 Sheldon  what is it ?
label2 That would have hurt her feelings 
label2 Oooaw  This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath 
label2 I'm sorry  I'm not seeing the help 
label2 Oh  I'm getting a bad feeling 
label2 Your cousin Leopold ?
label2 What's important ?
label2 I don't get it  I already told her a lie  why replace it with a different lie ?
label2 Okay  why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing 
label2 We're going to Long Beach ?
label2 So he goes back into rehab ?
label2 You still told her I lied 
label2 I don't know  How am I supposed to remember all of this 
label2 So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena  when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach ?
label2 Oh  well  thankyou 
label2 Oh  okay  alright  good 
label2 Howard  I'm sorry ' we're ' we're
label2 I don't know what to say 
label2 Howard  listen '
label2 Well ' I don't know what to say 
label2 Thanks Penny 
label2 Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold 
label2 What are you talking about  it's fine  she bought it  it's over 
label2 Why not ?
label2 There is no Leo  how can you say that ?
label2 I've got a solution 
label2 Get out 
label2 Who are you ?
label2 Oh  God ! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo 
label2 Yeah  I got it  Sheldon  why ?
label2 Well  that's Leo  Hey  um  why don't you tell me about your showcase last night ?
label2 There were only two people there ?
label2 As you can see  detoxing can get pretty ugly  let's give them some privacy 
label2 Sounds good 
label2 Gee  why wouldn't I ?
label2 Yeah ! Funny how things work out 
label2 How long is he going to stay here 
label2 O-o-o-o-h ! Again ?
label2 Just reset the board 
label2 Yeah  right here  How was Nebraska ?
label2 How was your family ?
label2 Sheldon  relax  she doesn't have any symptoms  I'm sure she's not contagious 
label2 Penny  you'll have to excuse Sheldon  he's a bit of a germophobe 
label2 You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol 
label2 What the hell are you doing ?
label2 With lime jello ?
label2 I don't think so 
label2 Sheldon  you are not sick  This is  but you are not 
label2 Sheldon  don't you think you're overreacting ?
label2 I'm going back to bed 
label2 What for ?
label2 I mix pancake batter in this !
label2 You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment  including the label maker  but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup ?
label2 Huh  I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology 
label2 They texted me 
label2 No kidding ?
label2 Alright  well  get some rest and drink plenty of fluids 
label2 Drink whatever you want 
label2 Then make soup 
label2 I'm at work  Sheldon 
label2 Yes  they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists  I have to go 
label2 Howard  it's Leonard  code Milky Green 
label2 Howard  listen to me 
label2 I tried to stop you 
label2 You call Koothrappali  we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours 
label2 Five movies  two hours apiece  It's a start 
label2 Oh  hi Penny !
label2 I'm ' uh ' at work 
label2 I'm ' uh ' in a ' I'm in a radiation suit  What's up ?
label2 Uh  yeah  I'd be ' I'd be happy to Penny 
label2 Oh dammit  my glasses  Okay  I'm blind here guys  can you help me find them ?
label2 Oh great 
label2 Yeah  at home 
label2 You want me to get eye surgery ?
label2 I'm thinking !
label2 What do you see  what do you see 
label2 Okay  he must be in his bedroom  My spare glasses are in my bedroom  on my dresser  next to my Bat-signal 
label2 Well I can't do it  I can't see anything 
label2 Won't my footsteps set it off ?
label2 Well  how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees ?
label2 Alright
label2 It wasn't on ?
label2 Okay  it's on 
label2 I know 
label2 Well  I had to  you see what he's like 
label2 W-wait !
label2 Wait ! Penny ! Take me with you !
label2 I don't think Penny's ever coming here again 
label2 Yeah  so ?
label2 Lay it on me 
label2 How about that 
label2 Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon ?
label2 Graduate work  very impressive 
label2 Advantage Kim 
label2 Yes sir 
label2 So  Dennis  how long have you been in America 
label2 No kidding  you speak English really well 
label2 Come on  Sheldon  we've hardly shown him anything 
label2 Huh  yeah ?
label2 Come on  Dennis  I'll show you the rec centre  they've got nautilus equipment 
label2 Not heavy ones 
label2 Something you'd like to share ? A tale of woe perhaps 
label2 Just eat  Sheldon  you'll feel better 
label2 You can't let this kid get to you  You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter 
label2 Okay  well  right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level  but I really don't need any help 
label2 Okay  Sheldon  I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis  you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully 
label2 Like what ? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is 
label2 Hang on  are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim ? I'm not saying no 
label2 That won't happen  he's not interested in anything but physics 
label2 Howard  he's fifteen 
label2 Okay  so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women 
label2 Like what ? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk  '
label2 No  we can't 
label2 I think that's our girl  One of us should go talk to her 
label2 Okay  that was uncalled for 
label2 The kid got a girl 
label2 Yeah  mission accomplished 
label2 Well  why do we go home alone every night  we're still smart 
label2 I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman ' you have to frisk me  I have a rocket in my pants  '
label2 Yeah  we really ruined his life 
label2 What did you spill on it ?
label2 I'll take a look at it 
label2 You're kidding  why not ?
label2 This is our year ! With those guys out  the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod 
label2 Come on  you need a four person team  we're four people 
label2 Sheldon  what  do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you 
label2 The needs of the many 
label2 The ladies ?
label2 Let's put it to a vote  All those in favour ' 
label2 Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question ?
label2 After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes  all of which the gentleman will lose  does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way ?
label2 I move we are the Army Ants  all those in favour ?
label2 Oh  uh  he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd  He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice 
label2 I was actually the one who noticed  okay  let's just start 
label2 I knew that too 
label2 Just ask another one 
label2 Howard  sit down 
label2 maybe we should take a little break 
label2 Can it wait  I need to talk to you 
label2 Why do they say AA ?
label2 Isn't that confusing ? AA might mean something else to certain people 
label2 Well  you're a friend  and you like Batman  and cookies  and you're off the team 
label2 Howard  Raj and I just had a team meeting 
label2 Yes we did  I just came from it 
label2 Okay  let me try it this way  you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more 
label2 Thanks for the heads up 
label2 He won't say  He just smiles  and eats macaroons out of his bat jar 
label2 How exactly would that laugh go ?
label2 Guys  let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate 
label2 So nothing  let's destroy him 
label2 We can't ask Leslie Winkle 
label2 Fine  Here I go  taking one for the team  In the sack  Hey Leslie 
label2 Leslie  I have a question for you  and it might be a little awkward  you know  given that I '
label2 There's not ? Gee  cos it sure sounds like there should be 
label2 That's all very comforting  but if it's okay  I'd like to get on with my question now 
label2 We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 So  is that your team 
label2 Here's your tee-shirt 
label2 No  it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad 
label2 Prevost's theory of exchanges 
label2 Come on  think  Leslie 
label2 You're never going to let that go  are you ?
label2 Hang on  Sheldon  is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team 
label2 Go ahead 
label2 Sorry  somebody's sitting there 
label2 My Physics Bowl Trophy !
label2 I know someone who would disagree 
label2 My Physics Bowl Trophy !
label2 You're right  I'm sorry 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Bring it on 
label2 How do you know these things ?
label2 Wait  I don't think it's Shatner 
label2 I don't believe it 
label2 Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it 
label2 No  a time machine from Sophie's Choice 
label2 Yeah  And that's my bid 
label2 It was a spur of the moment thing  I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it 
label2 Not to blow on a miniature time machine 
label2 Come on  snipers 
label2 Where are your snipers ?
label2 Snipe !
label2 Yeah  I know  I still can't afford it 
label2 I just assumed  Who sells a full sized time machine for $ 800 ?
label2 How are we going to get it upstairs ?
label2 Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years 
label2 Oh  just  you know  moving ' something upstairs 
label2 It's ' you know  time machine 
label2 Hey  if you wait for us to set up the time machine  I can drop you off at work yesterday  Time travel joke  it's not ' never mind 
label2 Let's just do this  Guys  ready to push ?
label2 Seconded 
label2 That sounds fair 
label2 Sheldon  you can't be selfish  we all paid for it  so it belongs to all of us  Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine 
label2 So  when it's your turn you can 
label2 Okay  I am setting the dials for January 10
label2 Are you okay ?
label2 That doesn't sound too bad 
label2 The lights flash and the dish spins  you wanna try it ?
label2 Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me ?
label2 What if I knocked you unconscious right now ?
label2 But it would make the present so much nicer 
label2 What was your first clue ?
label2 Yes I'm upset 
label2 Yeah  good for you 
label2 I don't know  Maybe 
label2 Uh  here's the thing  Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines 
label2 Thanks for pointing it out 
label2 Those are movies 
label2 Come on  guys  push 
label2 Don't worry baby  I've got you 
label2 I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell 
label2 Terrific  does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine ?
label2 Because I don't want it any more 
label2 Just ' personal reasons 
label2 Look  do you want to buy me out or not ?
label2 No  no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers  I'm getting rid of all of it 
label2 Not for long 
label2 It's not a bidding war  I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store 
label2 He offered me a fair price for the whole collection 
label2 Forget it guys  if I sell to one of you  the other two are going to be really mad at me 
label2 Sorry Raj  my mind is made up 
label2 Sheldon  get out of my way 
label2 No  I needed to hear it 
label2 Thanks  Hey  do you want to  I don't know  later '
label2 Sheldon  are you okay ?
label2 It is a little big for the living room  isn't it ?
label2 I'm glad you agree  I hired some guys to help us move it  come on in fellas 
label2 On the other hand  some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works  it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it 
label2 I don't know  Raj  Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board 
label2 Maybe she's his lawyer 
label2 Howard '
label2 Sheldon  are you going to introduce us ?
label2 You too  swell  also 
label2 So  how do you two know each other 
label2 Excuse me ?
label2 So Missy  what brings you all the way from Texas ?
label2 If the wedding's not until tomorrow  why don't you stay with us tonight ?
label2 So it's settled  You'll stay with us 
label2 Hee-hee  just classic 
label2 Yeah  no  I do  I use those ' uh ' just to polish up my ' spear-fishing equipment  I spear fish  When I'm not crossbow hunting  I spear fish  Uh  Penny  this is Sheldon's twin sister  Missy  Missy  this is our neighbour Penny 
label2 I wasn't staring !
label2 I brought snacks 
label2 We don't entertain much 
label2 Uh  yeah  no  uh  bye Penny 
label2 Excuse me  this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister 
label2 How do I have Penny ? In what universe do I have Penny ?
label2 Hell  no !
label2 Sheldon  can I talk to you in private ?
label2 Thank you 
label2 Sheldon  are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman ?
label2 That's fascinating  but I '
label2 Alright  noted  But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz ' they're hitting on your sister 
label2 Whatever  You have to do something about it 
label2 Because she's your sister 
label2 Okay  uh '  oh  consider this  With your father gone  it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 He's the man of his family  you have to respect his wishes 
label2 Say what ?
label2 We all make mistakes  let's move on 
label2 Sheldon  you are really being unreasonable 
label2 I agree  Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time 
label2 Sit down 
label2 If we're going to fight over Missy  let's do it the right way  The honourable way 
label2 And he's down !
label2 Stay down  bitch  Yeah  ha ha  natural selection at work 
label2 Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news 
label2 Hi Penny  how's it going  Listen  that guy Mike that you were dating  is that still going on ?
label2 Well  since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me ?
label2 Oh  You have other plans  or ' ?
label2 Oh  it's called trestling 
label2 Forget about the cake  how did you know that my birthday is Saturday ?
label2 Oh  I don't think so 
label2 I don't celebrate my birthday 
label2 Thank you 
label2 No  But it was okay  I mean  when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind  and surprise me with a party  like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson  and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front  and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering  and I could smell German chocolate cake  which is my favourite 
label2 Uh  it turns out my grandfather had died  '
label2 Oh  it was kind of like a birthday party  I got to see all my cousins and there was cake  so ' 7
label2 Howard  every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts  They see me coming they go ' ah  no peanut boy ! '
label2 Seen it 
label2 Look  I am in the Halo battle of my life here  there's this kid in Copenhagen  he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7 
label2 Not if you believe his doctors 
label2 Here you go  Copenhagen boy  how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade 
label2 What's the matter ?
label2 Oh my God  why did you eat it ?
label2 Well if I had a gun there  would you have shot yourself ?
label2 Why not ?
label2 Excuse me  my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts 
label2 Yes he is 
label2 You know  before you got all swollen up  I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party 
label2 There is a party  isn't there 
label2 Howard 
label2 how could I be mad ? You actually risked your life because you cared about me 
label2 Alright  Here we go  My first birthday party 
label2 Oh  it's okay 
label2 Hey Penny  when  uh  when's your birthday ?
label2 If I were you  I'd be more concerned by what they're passing off as chicken 
label2 Oh  yeah  no  sure  go ahead 
label2 Penny  are you okay ?
label2 Look  I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful ' 
label2 Okay  feel better  bye 
label2 It was Penny's boyfriend's  they broke up 
label2 You know what  I'm going to go back and try talking to her again 
label2 I'm not going to do that  Howard 
label2 What about ' damsel in distress ? '
label2 I don't care  She's upset  I'm going over there 
label2 I'm her friend  I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability 
label2 I said I'm her friend  Not her gay friend 
label2 No  No 
label2 Of course not 
label2 I'm sorry  what were the choices again ?
label2 Yeah  no  sure 
label2 Actually it's not all that easy to find 
label2 Okay  well  what exactly did this guy write  not that I need to know the details of your sex life  I just thought '  never mind 
label2 Okay  well  you know  this isn't that bad  It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who's open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales 
label2 Elevators  parks  movie theatres  out of curiosity  is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop ?
label2 Doesn't that violate the health code ?
label2 Huh  Okay  But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed 
label2 Maybe a little 
label2 No  No  no  that  that would be underreacting  He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and  in your case  the elevator  parks and fast food franchise 
label2 Yes  you should  go ahead  say it 
label2 I'm pretty sure I never said that 
label2 Aw  good for me  Where are you going ?
label2 Oh  sure  Huh  maybe I am her gay friend 
label2 Can we please change the subject 
label2 Just roll the dice 
label2 She was mad at him  She was done with him  the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it !
label2 What happened ?
label2 Yeah  I know  I know that part 
label2 Already  that was quick 
label2 Oh  Penny  I am so sorry 
label2 Oh  well  you know  you did throw an 8 gig iPod ' yeah  no  how could he do that 
label2 Yeah  that must get old quick 
label2 What about me ?
label2 What about if you went out with me ?
label2 Um ' yes ' I am ' asking you out 
label2 I was just going off your comment about the nice guy '
label2 Yes what ?
label2 Really ?
label2 Yeah  That's the spirit 
label2 Sheldon  I think I've made a mistake 
label2 No  it's about Penny 
label2 I don't think I can go out with her tonight 
label2 Other people would say ' why not ? '
label2 Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny  I'm not excited  I'm nauseous 
label2 Sheldon  this date is probably my one chance with Penny  what happens if I blow it 
label2 Wow  that's brilliant 
label2 I made an eight o'clock reservation 
label2 Oh  Okay  But before you say anything  have you ever heard of Schrodinger's Cat ?
label2 So you see  what you're eating is not technically yoghurt  because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures  It's really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness 
label2 What was your question again ?
label2 So  gas 
label2 Well  good night 
label2 There was a draft 
label2 Why don't we just go into your ' 
label2 No  no  I didn't mean to go into your apartment to ' go fast 
label2 Yeah  okay  sure  no problem  why don't we just figure out where we're going  and when we want to get there  and then rate of speed equals distance over time  Solve for R 
label2 That might work too 
label2 Bite me  Sheldon  how could you just sit there and let them spy on me ?
label2 Okay  so  she said she wants to slow things down  It's like saying ' I'm really enjoying this meal  I'm going to slow down and savour it  '
label2 I'm not the fish 
label2 Okay  alright  let's assume your hypothesis  We went to dinner  we talked  we laughed  we kissed  where could I have possibly gone wrong 
label2 I didn't say anything like that 
label2 That's not a bad sign 
label2 I'm not there because I'm taking things slow  Which  by the way  compared to you guys approaches warp speed  And take down that camera 
label2 You could be Batman ?
label2 Hey  Penny  if you're not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie 
label2 What about Saturday ?
label2 Great  So you just let me know when you know  So '
label2 No I didn't 
label2 What's going on with you ?
label2 What's wrong with your face ?
label2 Yeah  there kind of does 
label2 I'm still confused 
label2 It's not you  Howard  he says he's moving out 
label2 I didn't do anything  he's just gone insane 
label2 Where are you gonna live ?
label2 This could work 
label2 I'm coming !
label2 What's with him ?
label2 I still don't know why you left 
label2 You promised Penny what ?
label2 What secret  Tell me the secret 
label2 Not that secret  the other secret 
label2 Dammit  Sheldon ! You said Penny told you a secret  what was the secret 
label2 I promise 
label2 So it's nothing I did ? It's her problem ?
label2 Penny thinks I'm too smart for her  that's ridiculous 
label2 Yeah  hi  listen  I know what's been bothering you about us  and I have the answer 
label2 First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault  he tried very hard to keep your secret  if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave 
label2 A place for fun  a place for knowledge  See  this man here's playing hacky sack  and this girl's going to be a paralegal 
label2 Well  it's really not that fancy  it's just a city college 
label2 That doesn't matter to me at all 
label2 Absolutely 
label2 Please let it go  Sheldon 
label2 So  yeah  good to see you 
label2 It wasn't awkward  It wasn't fun  Besides  what's the big deal  we dated  we stopped dating  and now we're both moving on 
label2 Can we please just go in  my chain mail is stuck in my underwear 
label2 You went out and bought linen ?
label2 Borrowed ?
label2 Of course  Out of respect 
label2 What ? I've dated plenty of women  There was Joyce Kim  Leslie Winkle 
label2 Why not ?
label2 What happened to you ?
label2 Yes I have  it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone 
label2 Look  I like Leslie  but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release 
label2 Hey  Leslie 
label2 Uh  sure 
label2 Where did you hear that ?
label2 Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory  Yep 
label2 Are you suggesting another bout of stress release 
label2 Really  what changed ?
label2 Yeah  I can see how that would ' a bunch of people ?
label2 Oh  I'm flattered  So  how do you suggest we proceed ?
label2 Sounds fun 
label2 Thank you  that's very thoughtful 
label2 Terrific 
label2 Well  the thing is  someone's coming over 
label2 Sheldon  it's a date  I have a date coming over 
label2 Why  what's so unusual about me having a date ?
label2 Alright  alright  Well  uh  nevertheless  I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would  you know  make yourself scarce 
label2 Yeah  it's from Changs 
label2 No  Changs 
label2 It changed 
label2 A little 
label2 I sure hope so 
label2 Okay  now my uncles are bald  but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet  So ' Sweet lady  It always tickles when she hugs me 
label2 Listen  I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions  he can be a bit of an eccentric 
label2 Well  I think tonight was a very good start 
label2 No problem  I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse  So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening 
label2 Okay  well  goodnight 
label2 Hey  why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us 
label2 Don't make this hard for me 
label2 You're right  it is simple 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Okay  well  there is a lot of merit to both theories 
label2 Sorry Leslie  I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy 
label2 Truth  what truth ? We're talking about untested hypotheses  uh  it's no big deal 
label2 I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory 
label2 Wait  where are you going ?
label2 What's the bright side ?
label2 Great  you know there are groceries outside of your apartment ?
label2 I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife 
label2 Want to catch me up ?
label2 Hey  check it out  it's just corn starch and water 
label2 Beats me  They were playing all last night too 
label2 No  that's Marcie  Peppermint Patty's just athletic 
label2 Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone 
label2 Well  what am I supposed to do ?
label2 You mean  up until now we've been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon ?
label2 I'll go talk to her 
label2 Yeah  I see that  Shouldn't you be at work ?
label2 It's Thursday  Listen  Penny 
label2 Well  i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment 
label2 Penny  you've got cheetos in your hair 
label2 Penny's been keeping him up at night 
label2 She's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan  she's playing non-stop 
label2 Sheldon  wake up 
label2 That's not what she's doing  Leslie  she's just trying to shore up her self esteem  it has nothing to do with sex 
label2 Leslie  you are way off base here 
label2 Excuse me  this whole idea is insane 
label2 Sheldon '
label2 Hi Tom  Sheldon ? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria ?
label2 Chosen by science ?
label2 You got Penny to sign up for online dating ?
label2 This is bad 
label2 Penny  you don't have to do that 
label2 Oh yeah  two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen 
label2 You'd do the dolphins 
label2 Are you proud of yourself ?
label2 Well  we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner 
label2 Well  he came over last night with some pretty good news  and we weren't very supportive 
label2 Really  do tell 
label2 Okay  let's try it this way  what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve ?
label2 Come on 
label2 Not really  it's what you and I would call condescension 
label2 And when we go in there  let's show Raj that we're happy for him 
label2 Close enough  come on 
label2 Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing  Right Sheldon ?
label2 Dr Gablehauser 
label2 You can stop smiling now 
label2 You just got him this afternoon 
label2 Almost 
label2 Well  uh  no I ' the ' no 
label2 You look very nice 
label2 Good night 
label2 Terrific 
label2 Anythingforagreencardcom ?
label2 You're joking 
label2 It's not a date  and that's racist 
label2 Let's just eat so I can get to bed  With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me 
label2 You're welcome 
label2 Just sit down and eat 
label2 Do the shrimpers feature in your story ?
label2 He's irony impaired  just move on 
label2 A griffin ?
label2 And mythological 
label2 That may well be  but the fact is  it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people 
label2 If we do get a new friend  he should be a guy you can trust  A guy who has your back 
label2 Yeah  let's see  money  women  technology  okay we're agreed  our new friend is going to be Iron Man 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 I'm not going to work 
label2 Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights  and that you'd have to make other arrangements 
label2 Goodnight  Sheldon 
label2 Take the bus 
label2 You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords ?
label2 Oh  you're a big boy  you'll figure it out 
label2 I just got here 
label2 Sheldon  I told you  I only have access to the free-electron laser at night  I can't drive you for the next few weeks 
label2 Howard  help me out here 
label2 How did you get here in the first place ?
label2 Look  I need to get to the laser lab  you're just going to have to find someone else to take you home 
label2 Sheldon  you need to learn how to drive 
label2 Penny's taking you to the DMV  I'm going to bed 
label2 Because rock breaks scissors  goodnight 
label2 Okay  now  what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive 
label2 Okay  fasten your seat belt 
label2 Okay  now shift into drive  pull out slowly into traffic 
label2 Watch  watch out  watch out for pedestrians !
label2 How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria ?
label2 Aw  the pet store ?
label2 So what is it you're doing ?
label2 No kidding 
label2 Yes  you are  you're meant to learn how to drive  Please learn how to drive !
label2 Fine  Assuming that everything you say is true  how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning ?
label2 Well  hang in there  maybe you'll evolve into something with wings 
label2 Well  since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive  he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I'm finished with my experiment 
label2 So  if any of you are considering going into experimental physics  my door is always open  Once again  I'm sorry that the demonstration didn't quite work out  but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser  Short answer is ' don't  And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr  Sheldon Cooper  Dr  Cooper ?
label2 Excuse me  Sheldon  we both agreed to do this 
label2 If you don't do this  I won't take you to the comic book store 
label2 Oh  good God 
label2 No  if you can talk to them  you can ask them out 
label2 Hey  Leslie 
label2 Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork 
label2 Hey  Ramona  Come on in 
label2 Uh  the kitchen's fine 
label2 Oh  yeah  No  we were just going 
label2 No  come on  now  we're going out 
label2 Let's go  Okay  you two  just  have a nice ' whatever this is 
label2 What do you mean ' deal ' ?
label2 Honestly  we've been operating under the assumption that he has no deal 
label2 On the other hand  I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species  and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton 
label2 Hey  do you want to hang out with us ?
label2 Hey  aren't you having breakfast ?
label2 Touche 
label2 Ah  hey Leslie 
label2 Hey  Penny 
label2 Why ? What are they doing ?
label2 Seriously ? You're not coming ?
label2 Okay  well  once again  you guys have a good ' whatever this is 
label2 I don't know Morse code 
label2 Sheldon  I'm not going to learn Morse code at three o'clock in the morning !
label2 Don't come in here  don't come in here  don't come in here  don't
label2 I know  When is she going home ?
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that's taking over the Earth 
label2 The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who's been replaced with an alien pod 
label2 Not unless she destroys Tokyo 
label2 Really ? Define it 
label2 No  no  don't tell her 
label2 They're gorgeous 
label2 Yeah  and they can all move in with you and your mother  the current Mrs  Wolowitz 
label2 Did I miss anything ? Did they kick Giselle off ?
label2 Sheldon  the food's here 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 I asked 
label2 Just eat 
label2 Here you go 
label2 Put it on the agenda 
label2 Oh  I'll make a motion  but you're not going to like it 
label2 No  no  no  ' no  I don't think that's where it was 
label2 Don't worry  They only stay on your record for a year 
label2 Congratulations  You're officially one of us 
label2 Yeah  yeah  Uh  see  here's the thing  after you leave  I still have to live with him 
label2 Listen  don't worry  I'll talk to him 
label2 Just so I know  would you be open to taking his class ? You can do it online !
label2 To do what ?
label2 Are you insane ? You're not going to party with them  you're not even going to get anywhere near that place 
label2 Penny  can I talk to you for a minute ? Hi 
label2 Look  here's the thing  um  I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line 
label2 Yeah  so just apologize to him  okay ?
label2 Oh  come on  it's easy  he'll even tell you what to say 
label2 We're not encouraging  It's more like knuckling under 
label2 Well  actually  technically  you did do it 
label2 You can recognize people on Google Earth ?
label2 NORAD ? You're using military aircraft ?
label2 Sheldon ? I just dropped him off at the comic book store  Why ?
label2 Problem with the WiFi ?
label2 Oh  Penny  you don't want to get into it with Sheldon  The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain 
label2 There  see ? Problem solved 
label2 Thanks a lot  Howard 
label2 Hey  you guys are talking again  Good  What happened ?
label2 Oh  not junior rodeo  What did you do ?
label2 No  Look  this has to stop 
label2 All right  I really didn't want to do this  but ' here 
label2 He can never know that I gave that to you 
label2 Okay  for the record what you're doing is really creepy 
label2 Your mother 
label2 Are you kidding me ? I already have two strikes 
label2 Compromise  Watch Babylon 5 
label2 Well  five is partway between three ' Never mind 
label2 Ahoy  matey 
label2 You're not gonna need wingman  you're gonna need a paramedic 
label2 Well  I want to watch it now 
label2 Watch whatever you want 
label2 Howard's at the Mars Rover lab  He says he's in trouble  Defcon 5 
label2 Can we just forget I said Defcon and go ?
label2 What's the emergency ?
label2 Wait a minute  so the eye patch and the insults worked ?
label2 Just said Howard's a terrific guy  He's got a great sense of humour  he loves his mother  a lot  some people say too much 
label2 Yeah  I am loyal  You know  if you look at the big picture  Just  out of curiosity  did he ever have a shot with you ?
label2 Then why did you ?
label2 Ooh  Cool 
label2 Psst ! Psst !
label2 Yeah  Listen  I have to kinda sneak out for a while 
label2 I can't tell you that 
label2 I can't tell you that  either 
label2 Yeah  I really didn't think this through 
label2 I don't know  Just tell them I went to the office 
label2 Just say  Leonard went to the office 
label2 I'm going to the office 
label2 So how was work today ?
label2 I'm hoping that's three different guys 
label2 Oh  you know  I'm a physicist  so  I thought about stuff 
label2 Well  I wrote some of it down 
label2 Uh  yeah 
label2 If I knew you were waiting  I would've swallowed that lasagna whole 
label2 I've had her brisket  Melts in your mouth 
label2 That's a good idea  There's a bed in there  and I'm very  very  very pro-bed 
label2 Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested ?
label2 Dear God  no !
label2 Yeah  a couple 
label2 I'm sorry ?
label2 So  uh  what we did was in fact dating ?
label2 Oh  she's a doctor 
label2 On what ?
label2 Are you sure ?
label2 Does that change things ?
label2 So why'd you ask ?
label2 Listen  I need to talk to you about something 
label2 Oh  hey  guys 
label2 Hi  Howard  Howard ?
label2 That's just ridiculous  Why are you cooperating with him ?
label2 Howard  come on  I didn't plan on this  These things just happen  Usually not to me  but they do happen 
label2 Yeah  but I don't see a better one on the horizon  so '
label2 Hmm  Lisa's gonna be disappointed 
label2 I'm glad you're enjoying yourself 
label2 I stand corrected 
label2 She doesn't mean it  She's just being nice 
label2 Uh  Sheldon ?
label2 Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date ?
label2 Okay  here's my question  why did you sit down ?
label2 What landing party ?
label2 Oo-oo-oh !
label2 What invitation ?
label2 Oh  clearly I could have 
label2 Not the right seats 
label2 He's finding the acoustic sweet spot 
label2 Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone  I am really sorry about this 
label2 What  Sheldon ? What  Sheldon ? What  Sheldon ?
label2 The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial ?
label2 Stephanie Barnett is single 
label2 Okay  I'm going to make this very simple for you  You are not in this relationship  I am  Ergo  you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie 
label2 General Order 104  Section A does not apply in this situation 
label2 Because this is not Star Trek
label2 All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria  why can't they do something about lactose intolerance ?
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Excuse me  What the hell is wrong with you ?
label2 By making constipated moose sounds ?
label2 Huh ? Would it work if I just punched you in the face ?
label2 Oh  for god's sakes 
label2 No  no  no  I got it 
label2 No  I'm not  I'm bleeding 
label2 Stitches ? With a needle ?
label2 Oh  okay  yeah  hang on a sec 
label2 I can't remember a time when you weren't talking 
label2 I did not burst into tears  my eyes just got a little watery 
label2 She stuck a needle into my hand !
label2 I didn't cry 
label2 Hey  can you open this for me ?
label2 What for ?
label2 What ? no  no  that's not right 
label2 It's not bold  it's a mistake  I didn't change my status 
label2 You hacked my facebook account ?
label2 Are you insane ? Now she's going to think I'm desperate  You've destroyed this relationship ! And you want to know what the worst part is ? You don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in !
label2 Don't even ! I don't want to hear another word out of you 
label2 Really ? Oh  look at that  I have a girlfriend 
label2 No  it's more of a relentless  narcissistic drone 
label2 Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies 
label2 Okay  I'll be right in 
label2 Do you understand that Stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments ?
label2 Good night 
label2 No  you're not 
label2 Thank you 
label2 We're not living together 
label2 That's absurd 
label2 Wait  I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen ! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers 
label2 I'm going to bed 
label2 No  absolutely not 
label2 I don't care what the symptoms are  my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam 
label2 Oh come on ! Sheldon  we don't ask questions like that 
label2 She's heard about you because we're  you know  involved and you haven't heard about her because ' I never slept with her  I swear !
label2 Thank you  Sheldon 
label2 Look  I'm just saying  um  Penny is one of our many neighbours  you know  and in our building  neighbours come and go  it's very casual  no dress code  In fact  some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs  Vartabedian 
label2 Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam ?
label2 We're not living together 
label2 How could I not be sure ?
label2 Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first one to know about it ?
label2 We're not living together 
label2 We're not living together 
label2 Uh  the big dog is Goofy  and the older couple with the mouse ears  I have no idea  We're not living together !
label2 We're not ' Where's my Bat Signal ?
label2 I did  It was right here  She must've ' Oh  my God  we're living together 
label2 Yeah  Stephanie got them for me 
label2 At least I have an egg  What do you have ?
label2 So  go hit on her 
label2 I don't care what you guys think  Stephanie and I are very happy living together  I will give either of you 20 dollars  right now to trade pants with me 
label2 Oh  good  Do you have any fabric softener ?
label2 No  the pants that Stephanie got me 
label2 Oh  no  I wish you'd told me that sooner 
label2 No  everything's fine 
label2 Yeah  It's wonderful  Okay  maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly  but it's fine  it's great 
label2 No that doesn't sound right either 
label2 Yeah  I could say something like that to her  I'll go do that  Thank you 
label2 You have a really good grasp on this  Maybe you could talk to her ?
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Listen  we need to talk 
label2 It's just a little scary 
label2 Okay  and it's perfectly okay to express those feelings  right ?
label2 Okay  well  I ju ' I think it's important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and ' oh  shoot  I had it !
label2 What's that ? Really ? Right now ?
label2 I just ate  aren't you supposed to wait an hour ?
label2 Thank you 
label2 Well  um  on one level  really  really well 
label2 Not specifically  but  uh  I did tell her that I had feelings 
label2 Um  little bit 
label2 Yeah  yeah it's all good  Everything's going to work out  One way or another 
label2 Really ?
label2 Nothing  just rethinking my whole life  Okay  here's the thing  I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out  she'll just dump me 
label2 I really like you  but I want to see how things go with Mark ?
label2 Oh  right  yeah  um  so  Stephanie  here's the thing  I really like you 
label2 What speech ?
label2 No ! No  no ! I wasn't going to say any of that  I was just going to say  I really like you 
label2 Terrific 
label2 Yeah  yeah  that's the fun part  We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom  and a dust ruffle  and a duvet  and I don't even know what a duvet is but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one  but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex 
label2 Isn't that kind of cowardly ?
label2 Sold  ' I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place  ' There  It's done 
label2 Yeah  good for me  I'll never have sex again 
label2 Raj  please  let's stay serious here  Superman's body is Kryptonian  therefore his sweat is Kryptonian 
label2 It's David Underhill  So what ?
label2 I have two words for you  The first is big  the other's whoop 
label2 Did not 
label2 Uh  yeah 
label2 Uh  y-yeah 
label2 Wow  y-yeah  sure  Yeah  no problem  Uh  Here's my home number  here's my cell  here's my office  here's my parents ' number up in New Jersey  they always know how to reach me  So '
label2 Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant  by the way  Big fan 
label2 Actually  I was '
label2 Come on  it's just a video game  And we suck at it 
label2 He's funny  too  He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex  What are you wearing ? That's not  he does it better  Anyway  he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow  so I'm gonna go practice my situps 
label2 Yeah  I guess 
label2 I had no idea it was so heavy  The thing just fell right over on me  didn't it ?
label2 Oh  yeah  It's just a little motorcycle accident 
label2 Yeah  lucky for the bike it landed on my leg 
label2 I'm not indoorsy  I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don't take melanoma lightly 
label2 Since when ?
label2 Since when ?
label2 Uh  yeah  I guess 
label2 Yeah  if you like that type 
label2 No  just neighbours 
label2 Actually  science is my lady 
label2 See ya  ' Bye  Penny  Have fun 
label2 That's funny  By the way  my leg is killing me  Thanks for asking 
label2 Yippee 
label2 Brilliant 
label2 Do whatever you want 
label2 My leg is killing me  Thanks for asking 
label2 Sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry ! Never mind  we're cool 
label2 Really ? Why would you say that ?
label2 He tried to take nude photos of you ?
label2 Oh  yeah  I'm so ' oh  that's terrible 
label2 Well  uh  the important thing is he's married and that's terrible !
label2 Lactose 
label2 Smooth 
label2 Come on  it's Christmas  just give me this one 
label2 By the way  my leg is killing me  Thanks for asking 
label2 Merry Christmas 
label2 Very good  thanks for asking  Come on in 
label2 Oh  a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons  Very thoughtful 
label2 Oh  then  I think you'll appreciate what I got you 
label2 You know  ' cause you're so into science 
label2 It's a Saturnalia miracle 
label2 Maybe we should start small 
label2 What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade ? He still punched me in the face with my own fists  Sorry  you little nerd  you were just in the wrong boys ' room at the wrong time 
label2 That'll do it 
label2 Uh-huh ?
label2 Howard  why don't we just work on the robot ?
label2 I'm begging you  stop talking 
label2 Howard  where you going ?
label2 I don't know  now they're just yelling about Popsicles  Sounds like Penny really got to him 
label2 Yes  we did  Kripke 
label2 No  don't make it so  Barry  we can't fight you tomorrow  our engineer is incapacitated 
label2 I need you to apologize to How '
label2 Come on  Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle 
label2 He's been in bed for two days 
label2 He's not with a ' does it really matter who or what he's with ? The guy is devastated 
label2 Okay  don't take this as a criticism  but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on 
label2 You know  like  most of the time  you're the easygoing Bruce Banner  but then  when you get angry  you kind of turn into  like  you know  grrrrr !
label2 Seriously ? Gamma rays ? Bruce Banner ? You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that ? Never mind  just  please go talk to him 
label2 She's a delightful woman  You'll love her 
label2 Oh  my God  That's Kripke's robot ?
label2 Sheldon  we have to call it off 
label2 What's this do  spin ?
label2 Run  Monte  run !
label2 Go  go  go  go !
label2 Well  so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood 
label2 Alright this is cruel  we better let him finish before his head explodes 
label2 Hey Kripke 
label2 Good luck getting time on it  The only people he lets use it are his friends 
label2 There you go  Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder 
label2 Yeah  I got the same one  And that's not a bathing suit  it's a tan line 
label2 Well  unless he's makes one out of wood like Gepetto  I don't think it's gonna happen 
label2 There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university  Roommate wanted  Whistlers need not apply 
label2 I assumed he was joking  You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side 
label2 I don't know  how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring ? Proximity and valence electrons 
label2 I suppose  I do miss whistling though 
label2 Aw  you picked up on that huh ?
label2 Come on ! There's over 200 questions  And look at some of these things  Sheldon is to camaraderie  as the space shuttle is to blank ?
label2 It's kinda cute  until you get to the scrotum 
label2 Sheldon  I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon 
label2 Well  remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet ?
label2 On the floor 
label2 Then why learn how to swim ?
label2 No ! no  my point is  if you want to learn how to make friends  then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum  Meet people  Talk to them  Take an interest in their lives 
label2 Sheldon  what are you doing ?
label2 No you're not  let's go 
label2 Sheldon  there is no algorithm for making friends !
label2 Yes  he's new at the zoo 
label2 Uh-oh  he's stuck in an infinite loop 
label2 I'm sorry  Can we please just do it one more time ?
label2 It's a little thing but you really do miss it 
label2 How was rock climbing ?
label2 In the bathroom 
label2 Can I whistle ?
label2 He had Lysine but changed it 
label2 I didn't think he had it in him 
label2 We've got to be missing something  Let's start again  The movie is playing here at 7:20  here at 7:40  here at 8: 10 and here at 8: 45 
label2 Why ? They're state-of-the-art digital projection  20 - channel surround sound 
label2 Well  it's gonna take at least an hour to eat  and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre 
label2 Sheldon  would you be prepared  on a non-precedential basis  to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency ?
label2 Bye  Sheldon 
label2 Interesting 
label2 Hey  Penny  How was work ?
label2 Stop it !
label2 He's not lying  he does find that fascinating 
label2 Did you guys have an argument ?
label2 Well  you clearly did something to aggravate her 
label2 Here you go  Oh  you owe me another two dollars  The price of mu-shu pork went up 
label2 Here you go  Penny  Shrimp with lobster sauce 
label2 Don't worry about it  It's my treat 
label2 It's  whatever  Ten  eleven dollars 
label2 Fourteen fifty  but it's no biggie  you'll get the next one 
label2 It was fourteen fifty  but it's okay 
label2 Oh  wait  you lent her money ?
label2 Where are you going ?
label2 But if you're ever short  there's always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern's ass 
label2 A little mood lighting  huh ?
label2 Yeah  they're very considerate that way 
label2 Fourteen dollars  huh ?
label2 Back in the pocket it goes  Look  you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back  It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to  you know  kill him 
label2 So you're a little behind on your bills  Everybody gets behind on their bills 
label2 Well  what was the plan ?
label2 Was there a plan B ?
label2 It's probably not as bad as you think  Let's take a look  Maybe we can find some corners to cut  Oh  here's something  if you don't have electricity  then you probably don't need cable  Just a suggestion  170 dollars for acting classes ?
label2 Actually  it kind of ' let's keep looking  Whoa  what's eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court ?
label2 Nothing ? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4000 miles an hour 
label2 Your ex-boyfriend ?
label2 I would hope so 
label2 Did he pay you back ?
label2 Oh  no  Oh  you don't want to do that 
label2 Well  moving is a big deal  You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes  and if they're not clean  then your books smell like melons  and it's just  like ' Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here ?
label2 Well  I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you 
label2 Really ?
label2 Hey  what's going on ?
label2 ' Come on  It'll be fun 
label2 Do you guys remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt ?
label2 Really ? You're just gonna let me go by myself ?
label2 I could use some help 
label2 You guys are unbelievable  you play a game to simulate adventure  but when there's real adventure out there in the real world  you just wimp out 
label2 I'm not afraid of him 
label2 Excuse me  When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor  didn't Samwise  Pippin and Merry go with him ?
label2 Fine  Just enjoy your little game  I'll make this quest on my own 
label2 Guys  there are four of us and one of him 
label2 Hi  Kurt 
label2 I don't really go by Lenny  but that's okay  Um  you remember Sheldon  Howard and Raj 
label2 Sheldon  not now 
label2 Okay  here it is  Penny's in kind of a financial jam  and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems 
label2 No  no  she's too proud to ask for the money  I  on the other hand  feel you should honour your debt 
label2 Feel is a kind of a ' it's a strong word  Um  I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part 
label2 No  the problem isn't solved  He just blew us off 
label2 No  You can leave if you want to  I'm gonna see this through 
label2 I guess  technically  that was my fault 
label2 I don't need backup  I have right on my side  And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants 
label2 Yeah  Hang on  Sheldon !
label2 Really ? Did he say why ?
label2 That's it ? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany ?
label2 Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead !
label2 Can't we just postpone it till the spring ? Maybe next summer ?
label2 No  I didn't realize it had been so long  Sure  I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it 
label2 Aren't there any other options ? There's not a lot of room  it's gonna be uncomfortable 
label2 Okay  bye  My mother's coming to visit 
label2 Good to see you  Mother 
label2 Here's your tea  Mother 
label2 I'll start again 
label2 Here's your tea  Mother  So  what are you guys talking about ?
label2 Swell  If you're lucky  maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation 
label2 So  Mother  what's new ?
label2 All right  Uh  what's new with you ?
label2 Maybe something less personal 
label2 Yeah I  I thought you guys might hit it off 
label2 I hate to tell you  but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd 
label2 Please  don't go there  Howard 
label2 Why are you doing this ?
label2 That was fast 
label2 Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk  Go 
label2 He lives in the same room where his bassinet was 
label2 You brought your husband to work  you know the rules  Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too  betcha  betcha 
label2 There's no hurry  Mother  tell them more about their secret love for each other 
label2 You got alcohol ?
label2 Nothing  Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned 
label2 Oh  yeah  there she is  Hi  Mom 
label2 Did you get the part ?
label2 Hey  you want to talk about not getting love from a parent  You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact ?
label2 Of course she did  Anyway  that's not what I was gonna say  When I was ten years old  I built a hugging machine 
label2 You know what the saddest part was ?
label2 My father used to borrow it 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 Right  Ah ! Where's the lime ?
label2 This is actually gonna happen 
label2 You shush  I'm happy  I want to talk about it  You know what my mother would say about this ? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother  that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children 
label2 Ummm  I'm gonna go with ' no  '
label2 She said shush  I should have shushed 
label2 All right  Mother  Um  have a nice flight 
label2 Good-bye  Mother 
label2 There's no way we can get to the ridge  The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off 
label2 No  that shouldn't be a problem  Venus is up during the day  They're probably just all staring at the sky 
label2 Yeah  more cutbacks 
label2 You know what baffles me  Sheldon ?
label2 Hey  Leslie 
label2 Yeah  okay  but what's with the back-scratching and the meow !
label2 Thank you 
label2 Are you done ?
label2 What about it  Howard ?
label2 I don't care about that 
label2 Calm down  We'll figure it out 
label2 Here we go 
label2 Don't sit in his spot 
label2 Okay  that should do it 
label2 That's a lot of shoes you ordered 
label2 There's a chance 
label2 We ? No  no  no  you had your chance to be we for  like  a year and a half now  Right now  you are you  and you are screwed 
label2 Well  we're not gonna tell him I did it 
label2 We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend 
label2 Mm  butt print  There's no discernible butt print 
label2 You're welcome 
label2 Sheldon ! How was the comic book store ?
label2 Isn't that terrific ? He is such a good friend  You know what the best thing about friends is ?
label2 Don't you dare  missy 
label2 I don't know what you're talking about  Oh  that  Penny did that 
label2 Wackadoodle 
label2 If it were your head  it would be 
label2 Oh  for God's sake  Sheldon 
label2 No  it's Leslie Winkle  It's a long story 
label2 That's not fair  You're not even a physicist 
label2 Get out 
label2 I don't know  Texas ?
label2 Really ? Great  Sheldon  look  Good as new 
label2 Nothing  it's what's wrong with him 
label2 Penny  Penny  I think I know what to do  Sheldon  I have some bad news 
label2 I'm afraid so  You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights ?
label2 Szechuan Palace closed two years ago 
label2 I thought that might take his mind off the cushion 
label2 Yeah  buddy ?
label2 Okay  first of all  Penny  thank you for coming 
label2 Penny is an amazing shot  I think we have a real chance to win this week 
label2 Okay  Now  we all run out  Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees  Raj  Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks  Then we'll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight 
label2 What is it  Sheldon ?
label2 Sheldon  Penny was our only hope 
label2 He's right  You can't 
label2 Where are you going ?
label2 Okay  then we won't touch the hard drive  We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar 
label2 It's perfect 
label2 Yeah  I wish 
label2 Well  we had a vote  Three of us voted for airplane  Sheldon voted for train  so we're taking the train 
label2 Hey  we're all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar  You want to come ?
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Well  that does sound much simpler  How long is this going to take ?
label2 Wow  Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now 
label2 I wouldn't expect you to  I'll see you later 
label2 Why not ?
label2 Sheldon  we've been on this train 90 seconds  and you've already said a thousand words  Just tell us where to sit and shut up 
label2 Yeah  maybe  Meanwhile back in the 21st century  people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ' cause it's time to land in San Francisco 
label2 Oh  look  now he's boring on an international scale 
label2 Is that who I think it is ?
label2 Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator 
label2 Thank you 
label2 At least he's off the train crap 
label2 My money's on tuck and roll 
label2 Excuse me  but what about me ? Why don't I get a shot ?
label2 You know  I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can't score with  I think I'll let you two take this one 
label2 So aren't you going to go talk to her ?
label2 She's probably heard every possible line  Howard  Why don't you just try hello ?
label2 You're going to need more than 11 hours 
label2 Okay  Sheldon  I'm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive 
label2 Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot ?
label2 So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back 
label2 Right  Of course 
label2 Only ten hours  55 minutes to go 
label2 I've got a better idea 
label2 Boy  you take all the fun out of it for me  ' But look  Penny's home  Why don't we just call her  have her go in the apartment  get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper ?
label2 I see  Well  it seems once again  you're caught between a rock and a crazy place 
label2 He's calling to ask you a favour  You might be confused because he didn't use the words  Penny  Sheldon  please or favour 
label2 I don't know  Some sort of placebo effect  I guess 
label2 Hey  Penny  It's Leonard 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Hey  Penny  Leonard again 
label2 Hey  how'd it go ?
label2 Hi  my name's Leonard 
label2 Damn it  I slipped

label2 What are you doing ?
label2 How are we doing ?
label2 Sheldon  we still have 380 of these things to make 
label2 Yeah  no  But  Sheldon  without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail 
label2 I can't believe we actually did it 
label2 I'll print out the shipping label  Uh-oh 
label2 We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford  New Jersey  Gay  Lesbian  Bisexual and Transgender Alliance  They want another thousand Penny Blossoms

label2 Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box  Sheldon 
label2 You're right  It's Anything Can Happen Thursday  let's hit the clubs and meet hot women !
label2 Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store 
label2 Oh  absolutely 
label2 Sure  What does he like ?
label2 Don't worry  they're more scared of you than you are of them 
label2 Come on  I'll help you pick something 
label2 I think we're fine  Stuart 
label2 You mean for someone who's into comic books ?
label2 Ah  yeah  that's Captain Sweatpants  He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make 
label2 Problem ?
label2 Uh  cut it in half ?
label2 I don't believe it  Stuart's putting the moves on Penny 
label2 Nobody's up in anybody's business  let's just buy our stuff and go 
label2 Apparently so 
label2 When did you pick up on that ?
label2 Sure  why not ?
label2 Gee  thanks a lot 
label2 I don't need any insights  I just want to know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me  We're practically the same guy 
label2 You're right  I really should be asking strangers on the Internet 
label2 Hey  Penny ' and Stuart  hey Stuart 
label2 And you guys are going together  great '
label2 Take me to a bar with women 
label2 Should we talk to some of these women ?
label2 How about those two ?
label2 What about the ones in the corner ?
label2 I think Blinky's cute 
label2 Wait  so we just go over there ?
label2 What else you got ?
label2 I thought you were good at this  You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women 
label2 Well  what happened ? We've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called 
label2 Say what ?
label2 Fine  I'll sit here  You take flight and hunt 
label2 Actually  you can  There's a whole sport built around it  Falconry 
label2 God  I hope not  And no  I'm not Princess Leia 
label2 You got it 
label2 No  Look  imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with  but you were free to date whoever you wanted 
label2 Alright  back to the game 
label2 We were up to you 
label2 Okay  let's see  Are you from a TV series ?
label2 Sheldon  he obviously had feelings for her 
label2 Okay  uh look  you just need to get your mind off it  Do you want to go to the comic book store ? Maybe go see a movie ?
label2 I've never been there  have you ?
label2 Okay  then let's do this  lets go to Las Vegas 
label2 Hey  Sheldon  are you coming ?
label2 Great  we'll bring you back a tee-shirt 
label2 Howard  could I borrow some after shave ?
label2 Come on  let's go 
label2 Alright 
label2 Okay  uh  if I get lucky I'll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City  and if you get lucky  I'll sleep on the moon 
label2 Uh  Raj  can I  can I talk to you for a moment 
label2 Yeah  I really need to talk to you 
label2 Okay  I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is  but  I'm pretty sure she is a prostitute 
label2 Maybe  but I'm guessing it will cost you about $ 500 an hour to try 
label2 Oh  Howard's losing it  Check out his latest twitters  ' I'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss  My life is meaningless  my future is without hope  '
label2 I don't know  Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy 
label2 We're not going to get Wolowitz a hooker 
label2 Suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate 
label2 Yeah  hi  listen  m  if you're not busy  well  w-we were thinking you could ' well  we were wondering '
label2 Okay  great  Um ' uh  the thing is  we've got this friend  and he's kind of down in the dumps  and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up 
label2 I think she knows what I meant 
label2 Okay  terrific  Um  uh  listen  is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a ' you know '
label2 Yes  yeah  exactly  the girlfriend experience 
label2 Behold ?
label2 Hey  how's it going 
label2 What were you doing at Penny's ?
label2 Just think  Thanks to your hard work  an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
label2 Oh  sure  what's up ?
label2 Yeah  vaguely 
label2 What about it ?
label2 Oh  too bad  I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up  dust yourself off  forget it and move on 
label2 Why the hell not ?
label2 Nobody wants that 
label2 Yeah  or you call me 
label2 Or nobody calls anyone 
label2 You know  thanks for closed-captioning my pain  Raj 
label2 Oh  hi 
label2 Good  good  You ?
label2 About what ?
label2 No  no that's the past  I'm really more of a right now kind of guy  You know  living in the moment  Although I do have to live a little in the future  ' cause  well  that's my job  Of course  my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards  but those stories often take place in the future  In conclusion  no  it doesn't bother me 
label2 Yeah  well I wouldn't say cool  I'd just say  that's Leonard !
label2 About Stuart ? Love to 
label2 Well  uh  first of all  don't underestimate the value of discomfort 
label2 Well  yeah  Stuart thrives under pressure  that's why he works in a comic book store 
label2 Oh  It's Stuart 
label2 He wants to talk about Penny  I don't want to talk about Penny 
label2 Why would he call me ?
label2 I'm not answering the phone  Sheldon 
label2 No ! There  it went to voice mail 
label2 It must be hell inside your head 
label2 How teeny tiny ?
label2 Well  what are you gonna do ?
label2 So  what do you need us for ?
label2 Hey Stuart 
label2 Yeah  I'm sorry  it's been broken 
label2 Yeah  that too  Everything's broken 
label2 All right  well  off the top of my head  I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow  I mean  glacial 
label2 You know  guys come onto her all the time  so  you need to  like  set yourself apart  You know  be a little shy  don't make too much eye contact  And  you know  treat her with  like  cool detachment and  and  and  you know  fear 
label2 Yeah  like  you're afraid that if you touch her  she'll break 
label2 Good  good  Well  you kids have fun tonight 
label2 It wasn't bad advice  It just wasn't particularly helpful 
label2 I feel terrible 
label2 I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny 
label2 Morning 
label2 Nothing  We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity ' pasta maker  I'm gonna make a coffee run  Do you want any ?
label2 Comic book store 
label2 ' Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again  I'm going to kick him in his ovaries 
label2 Thanks for understanding  Howard 
label2 Hey  Stuart  I need to talk to you 
label2 I think I gave you bad advice about Penny  and I want to apologize 
label2 It was ?
label2 You're kidding  Never worked for me 
label2 During the kissing ? What did you do  sneeze in her mouth ? I did that to a girl once 
label2 Leonard ?
label2 Yeah  no  yeah  wow  I'm sorry  That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear 
label2 No doubt  no doubt  Okay  well  I'm sorry it didn't work out 
label2 Yeah  how about that ? See you soon 
label2 Howard's space toilet  I'll tell you later 
label2 Yes  you did  didn't you ?
label2 What was it doing on the ceiling ?
label2 There's nothing wrong with the science here 
label2 Yes  how did we live before Twitter ? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning 
label2 Yeah  I know the feeling 
label2 Sheldon  it's two o'clock in the morning 
label2 Everybody ?
label2 You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night ?
label2 Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it 
label2 Wait a minute  He offered to send you to the North Pole ?
label2 Okay  well  do you want to go ?
label2 Easy peasy  I'm doing it right now 
label2 Well  then don't go 
label2 All right  then go 
label2 Sheldon  what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep ?
label2 How was it resolved ?
label2 I could use the bathroom at 8: 20 
label2 Hang on  Let's talk about it  This is a National Science Foundation expedition  I don't know how we can turn it down 
label2 Howard  this is big science  You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines 
label2 I'm in 
label2 Yeah  Pretty cool  huh ?
label2 Oh  well  it all happened kind of fast  and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on  you know  snow and stuff  Sorry  I was gonna tell you 
label2 Actually  it would help 
label2 A little bit 
label2 I mean  I know she's not my girlfriend or anything  but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer ?
label2 I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves  Oh  son of a bitch !
label2 Okay  I can't do this 
label2 Sheldon  you know I can't eat butter  I'm lactose intolerant 
label2 Sure  but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt  What's up ?
label2 Oh  a blanket 
label2 Oh  wow  cool 
label2 Sheldon  Sheldon ?
label2 Sheldon  it's me 
label2 Listen  I don't know if I can go on the expedition 
label2 Yeah  that's very comforting 
label2 Terrific  it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go 
label2 Not exactly  But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this 
label2 It's a blanket with sleeves 
label2 Yes  obviously 
label2 So  I can't go 
label2 You really think so ?
label2 It's 7 a  m  I'm sorry it's early  but we're leaving soon  and I needed to talk to you 
label2 What did you mean when you said you're going to miss me ?
label2 All right  fine  What about that really long hug ? What did that mean ?
label2 It was at least five Mississippis  A standard hug is two Mississippis tops 
label2 Glad we cleared that up 
label2 I guess I'll see you 
label2 Thank you  Bye 
label2 Damn it 
label2 We're out of ice 
label2 Hey  guys  can I just say something ? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now ? This is literally the top of the world  Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see 
label2 Dinner's ready !
label2 Uh  oh  sorry 
label2 Oh  thank God we're home 
label2 I'm going to go let Penny know we're back 
label2 Yeah  I just stopped by to say '
label2 Damn his Vulcan hearing  Not a good time  Sheldon 
label2 It was the only way to make him happy 
label2 Because when he wasn't happy  we wanted to kill him  There was even a plan  We were going to throw his Kindle outside  and when he went to get it  lock the door and let him freeze to death 
label2 No  the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush  Look  we kept the original data  You can still publish the actual results 
label2 Yeah  I feel terrible 
label2 What ? Uh  he'll be fine  the guy's a trouper  come here 
label2 Well  he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force  so I'd say  a little better 
label2 Howard '
label2 Well  tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business 
label2 Sheldon  why are you sitting by yourself ?
label2 Come on  We said we were sorry 
label2 So much for our friendship with Sheldon 
label2 Hey  Listen  since we got  you know  interrupted last night  I didn't have a chance to give you this 
label2 It's a snowflake  From the North Pole 
label2 Uh-huh  It'll last forever  I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin 
label2 Man  I can not catch a break 
label2 Well  you know  I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and ' Oh  come on  I don't want to go to Texas !
label2 Trust me  you'll be fine  See ya 
label2 Yeah  but I already saw him naked  Just come here 
label2 Really ?
label2 Maybe you can 
label2 I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat 
label2 What can I tell you ? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there 
label2 Will you please take that stupid hat off ?
label2 Uh  no  thank you 
label2 Uh  if you don't mind  Mrs  Cooper  there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles  and you have no idea how much I want to be on it 
label2 Uh  yes  ma'am 
label2 We came to apologize 
label2 And bring you home  So  why don't you pack up your stuff and we'll head back 
label2 No  this is my home now  Thanks to you  my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists 
label2 How about that ? I finally caught a break 
label2 You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird ?
label2 Why does it have to get weird ?
label2 I mean  we were friends  and now we're more than friends  We're whatever this is  But why label it  right ? I mean  it is what it is and '
label2 Totally 
label2 Hey  guys 
label2 What do you mean ? It's new comic book night 
label2 There's more to life than sex  Raj 
label2 Nothing flamed out  We don't have to have sex every night  you know 
label2 It's not a matter of opportunity  We're getting to know each other  There's a learning curve 
label2 Nothing like that happened  all right ? The sex was just fine 
label2 I'm not saying it was bad  I'm just saying it ' wasn't great 
label2 All I know is  it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be 
label2 No  we went somewhere new 
label2 No  look  Mumbai Palace 
label2 What's that supposed to mean ?
label2 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh 
label2 Penny  wait  Aagh ! What is wrong with you ?
label2 Nothing bad  just that last night was fine 
label2 Yeah  it's a perfectly good word  You put it in front of wine or dining  and you've really got something  Okay  well  let me ask you this  how was last night for you ?
label2 So  you've been through this before ?
label2 Okay-dokay 
label2 So much 
label2 Actually  ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid 
label2 More wine ?
label2 What are we drinking now ?
label2 Why would you buy peppermint schnapps ?
label2 Schnapps  You're right  that is fun 
label2 God  I had the most horrible night 
label2 I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends 
label2 Hey  What's going on ?
label2 Wait a minute  You talked to Penny about our sex life ?
label2 Right  right  You're saying you talked to Penny ?
label2 Interesting 
label2 Excuse me 
label2 Hey  Uh  what did Sheldon say to you ?
label2 I guess 
label2 It would  wouldn't it ?
label2 Good  good 
label2 Morning 
label2 Sorry  I haven't given her your schedule yet 
label2 We did  but there were extenuating circumstances 
label2 Perfectly formed miniature human being 
label2 Don't do that 
label2 Sheldon  you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny 
label2 I'm just saying  you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar 
label2 Come on  you guys  let it go 
label2 What was that ?
label2 It does  But in my experience  you don't 
label2 Howard  what did you do ?
label2 Why are you carrying extras ?
label2 They're gonna get beaten up at that club 
label2 Okay  I know what you're doing 
label2 Yes  you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour 
label2 No  I don't want any chocolate ! Sheldon  you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat 
label2 Well  you shouldn't 
label2 No  this has to stop now 
label2 No  you're not sanding Penny 
label2 What could she possibly be talking about for so long ?
label2 You're not squirting her in the face with water 
label2 Forget it 
label2 I'm not  And Penny's qualities  both good and bad  are what make her who she is 
label2 You're not changing how Penny laughs 
label2 Unbelievable 
label2 I was just thinking  we should probably turn in too 
label2 Really  that's a lot of work  and it's kind of late 
label2 What do you mean ?
label2 We're watching Goonies  Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes  They were all written by Chris Columbus 
label2 What's he on trial for ?
label2 Oh  I'll be there 
label2 So  what's going on with Raj ?
label2 What do you mean  he's getting deported ?
label2 So  what's going on ?
label2 So  wait  what have you been doing for the past six months ?
label2 Wait  are you saying that he discriminated against you ? Because we should file a complaint 
label2 Excuse me  Sheldon  how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point ?
label2 Uh-huh  Now that Raj is working for Sheldon  I don't have to chauffeur him around anymore  Plus  yeah  with them working late so much  we get some privacy 
label2 What are you thinking ?
label2 You are a dirty girl 
label2 Hi  Howard 
label2 Little bit  yeah 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 You know  whatever 
label2 That was fun  Thank you 
label2 Oh  Okay  Tomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail  Just throw it away 
label2 What are you doing here ?
label2 Yeah  okay  Um  Howard  we need to talk 
label2 Uh  please understand that it's not that we don't want you around  but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time 
label2 Thank you  There's lox and cream cheese in the fridge  the bagels are in the oven  I was warming them up 
label2 Are you sure ?
label2 Okay  Howard come back 
label2 Okay  well  then I'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword  That's right  I did it  I cut ' em 
label2 Warlord beats troll  troll beats elf  elf beats water sprite  and basically everything beats enchanted bunny 
label2 Just play a potion card 
label2 See ? Ruined 
label2 Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory 
label2 See ya  Still can't believe she's going out with me 
label2 Yeah  I don't remember that 
label2 Howard  you can't hold me to that 
label2 Because when I made that agreement  I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend  And I was positive you never would 
label2 Oh  damn it  Can I have a napkin ?
label2 But you have a whole bunch of ' em 
label2 Fine  I'll ask if she has a friend for you 
label2 I'll see what I can do 
label2 Are you kidding ? I couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his freakin ' napkins 
label2 Over puppets ?
label2 Okay  Speaking of what the heart wants  um  a long time ago  I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you 
label2 No  no  nothing like that  The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend  we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends 
label2 Well  I sure as hell wasn't going to bring it up before sex  and during  I was trying to remember what I read on google  so '
label2 Come on  it doesn't have to be a good friend  And you know that deep down inside  Howard's a really nice guy 
label2 Will you at least think about it ? Just as a favour to me ?
label2 Girls don't count Klingon  Howard  Right ?
label2 Another delightful surprise for her 
label2 I had to ask  You didn't have to say yes 
label2 Long  long night 
label2 How about that ? Einstein was wrong 
label2 Approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time  Approaching them does 
label2 Kites  ho !
label2 If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin  he did not discover electricity  he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity  He also invented the Franklin stove  bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter  Kites  ho 
label2 We're heading out for some kite fighting 
label2 Oh  yeah  It's an extremely competitive  cutthroat sport 
label2 You want to come watch ?
label2 Oh  Football  sure 
label2 No  no  I'm not  so  great  You've got plans doing something you like  I've got plans doing something I like  so it's good 
label2 Yeah  great 
label2 Well  this sucks 
label2 Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me ?
label2 Maybe Koothrappali's right  maybe I embarrass her 
label2 So  Penny doesn't want me around her friends  I embarrass her  What else could it be ?
label2 How was your football party ?
label2 Oh  that's excellent  It's a weird figure of speech  isn't it  we won when you weren't
label2 Oh  hey  on a related subject  are you embarrassed to have me around your friends ?
label2 Well  you know  I just noticed I haven't really met any of them 
label2 Well  yeah  no  I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend  Were they here today ?
label2 Of course not  Why would they be ? Why would I ask ? Why am I rambling ? Why don't you stop me ?
label2 I wouldn't be bored  Why would I be bored ?
label2 Penny  I like all sorts of people  In fact  some of my best friends aren't geniuses 
label2 Okay  some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses  My point is  if we're going to be a couple  I should be friends with your friends 
label2 Another football game ?
label2 Did not know that 
label2 Okay  a complete pass  First down  New England  I think I'm starting to get this 
label2 Focus on the game  not the commercials  Raj 
label2 There's no fooling you  Now  what is this sacks statistic they put up there ?
label2 Sacks  sacks '
label2 Huh ' Scrimmage '
label2 Apparently 
label2 Sheldon  how do you know this stuff ?
label2 So you could teach me ?
label2 Football  I'm going to Penny's on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don't want to look like an idiot  I want to blend in 
label2 Come on  Sheldon  please teach me about football  It'll be fun 
label2 Please  I'm asking you as a friend 
label2 I'm sorry ?
label2 Anyway  wish me luck 
label2 Well  I wouldn't put it exactly that way 
label2 Yeah  okay  like you said 
label2 Good-Bye  Sheldon 
label2 Yeah  no  I'm trying to fit in  not get laughed at 
label2 Go ! Go ! Go ! Go-Go-Go-Go ! Yes ! Are you people watching this ? Is this amazing or what ?
label2 Oh  Did not know that 
label2 None  why ?
label2 Okay  yeah  I can see the difference 
label2 That completely was a forward pass  which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time  I can't believe they're not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul 
label2 Penny  you know I'm lactose intolerant 
label2 Mimesis ?
label2 What the hell are you talking about ?
label2 I don't want to fly kites  Sheldon  We're watching football here 
label2 Oh  look at that  The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field  I hope he's right  ' cause if he's not  it'll cost him one of his three time-Outs 
label2 This is just half ? We've been here for hours 
label2 Oh  you're kidding me 
label2 Nice meeting all of you 
label2 We must not be playing it right 
label2 Oh  gee  Sheldon  I don't think we can play on Sunday 
label2 Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you  Penny ?
label2 There you go  she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport  aAnd I can't play ' cause I'm going with her  right ?
label2 Wait  What are you talking about ?
label2 Who is this Justin ?
label2 No  you didn't 
label2 Hang on  Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch ?
label2 So by friend  do you mean friend friend  gay friend  or ex boyfriend who you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend ' ?
label2 Oh  a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend's couch  Yippee 
label2 Okay  not to be pedantic  but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out  which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked 
label2 What was your first clue ?
label2 I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot ! I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic !
label2 You know what ? It is your life  If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch  then fine  Why don't you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas ?
label2 Are you listening to yourself ? Do you know how childish you sound right now ?
label2 The two aren't mutually exclusive !
label2 He's drowning us out  He doesn't like fighting 
label2 No  we just had a little spat 
label2 I don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch 
label2 I don't want to play a game  Sheldon 
label2 And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy !
label2 Calm down  we'll make the movie 
label2 Hey  We're  uh  going to the movies 
label2 Just give us a minute 
label2 So  are we going to talk about last night ?
label2 No  there's a difference between being stupid and acting stupid 
label2 No  there isn't ! They're synonyms !
label2 Oh  we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits 
label2 Thanks  Stuart  Let me ask you something  Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch ?
label2 Thank you !
label2 I am not going to fold 
label2 What ? Who would tell you something like that ? Why would you tell her something like that ?
label2 Okay  yeah  it's true  but I can live with that stuff  What I can't live with is you casually informing me that some guy's going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first !
label2 Oh  come on  Sheldon  have you ever once heard me say that I don't trust Penny ? Sheldon ? Where did he go ?
label2 Where are you going ? You just walk away in the middle of an argument ? !
label2 Why didn't you say so ?
label2 What are you doing ? He's not a lost dog 
label2 The brake might be imaginary  but that stop sign you just ran wasn't 
label2 Eyes on the road  Eyes on the road !
label2 Thank you 
label2 I'm not leaving until you talk to me 
label2 It's a little hard to explain  He does this thing where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in  but he can't perceive us 
label2 Always is a long time  Sure  Always 
label2 Oh  come on  he's just going to play with it twice  and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk 
label2 Uh  t-minus five hours  37 minutes to onset of meteor shower 
label2 Uh  we have a signal  but there's no frame lock 
label2 Oh  hey  Dune 
label2 Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us 
label2 Come on  you guys can't be that hard up 
label2 Of course  they did  That's what grandmothers do 
label2 Mmmm  not bad 
label2 Stars are pretty  aren't they ?
label2 I can feel it  I can feel the earth moving  It's moving too fast  Raj  slow it down 
label2 What's so funny ?
label2 People could call me Angie  Yo  Angie  how's it goin ' ?
label2 No  That was the last pudding cup 
label2 That's what he used to eat his pudding  remember ?
label2 The only thing in here are blue ice packs 
label2 Will you shut up ? We're all hungry 
label2 What kind of score are we looking at ?
label2 All right  everyone grab flashlights 
label2 Quick  get forks 
label2 I feel like we're forgetting something important 
label2 With Penny and me  it took two years  Now that I think about it  that was three dates 
label2 No  she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open 
label2 The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates 
label2 Never mind  what's your announcement ?
label2 Are you really going to be on NPR ?
label2 Very cool  congratulations 
label2 You know  when Sheldon gives you homework  you don't have to do it 
label2 You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall 
label2 Excuse me  I'm sitting here 
label2 Again  I'm right here 
label2 I am here  right ? You see me 
label2 Come on  it wasn't that bad 
label2 Okay  so Kripke played a joke on you 
label2 I fell on the floor  All right  he got you  you can get him back 
label2 Are you really admitting defeat ?
label2 What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look ?
label2 You're not helping 
label2 Sheldon  what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke  like  uh  like  how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane 
label2 No  no 
label2 Okay  uh  that's the spirit  but  um  let's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance 
label2 Let's keep thinking 
label2 This is brilliant  Sheldon  How are we going to deploy it in Kripke's office ?
label2 Let me guess  motion sensors ?
label2 I gotta say  I am really impressed  This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even 
label2 Who is that with him ?
label2 And the board of directors  Abort ! Abort !
label2 I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food 
label2 Yeah  Hey 
label2 Sure  The more  the merrier 
label2 Sheldon '
label2 Relax  it'll be fine  sit down  you guys 
label2 That's where Sheldon sits 
label2 I am  Are you interested in physics ?
label2 Actually  my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point  Right now  we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential 
label2 Yes  I am  You want to see a simulation on my laptop ?
label2 Hey  look  it's Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette 
label2 Yeah  no  I got it 
label2 Ah  terrific  We're getting the electron accelerator set up  We should be ready to go day after tomorrow 
label2 Excuse me ?
label2 Yeah ? So ?
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 Howard  relax  I'm not interested in your girlfriend 
label2 I believe you 
label2 What did I do now ?
label2 What was I supposed to tell her ?
label2 And what would that be ?
label2 You told her my experiment was stupid ?
label2 Okay  good  ' cause I wasn't really gonna go 
label2 We're shocked 
label2 Or loud noises  clowns and nuns 
label2 I don't know  Maybe because I'm crazy ?
label2 When we watch Frosty the Snowman  he roots for the sun 
label2 We didn't have a tree when I was growing up 
label2 Mmm  in a way  We presented papers  and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other 
label2 Merry Newton-mas  everyone 
label2 No  he doesn't 
label2 Tomorrow 
label2 Um  tomorrow ?
label2 Well  I just  I thought '
label2 You are  it's just '
label2 I know  And those specials  they change every day 
label2 I drove  Mother  I'm driving now 
label2 Wait  wait  wait  When did you send my mom notes on a paper ?
label2 Wait  wait  wait  You had surgery ?
label2 No  I heard that 
label2 Fine  Mom  How are you ?
label2 Now I'm less fine 
label2 No  Sheldon  why didn't you tell me ?
label2 You must be very happy 
label2 I don't know what you're talking about 
label2 All right  He ' has ' a ' girlfriend  '
label2 Oh  glad you're here  uh  sit down  I'll get you a plate  Mom  you remember Penny 
label2 When did this happen ?
label2 Mitzy's dead ?
label2 I don't believe this  Why am I the last to know ?
label2 What is it ?
label2 I don't want tea 
label2 Then why are you telling me ?
label2 That's a lousy conversation starter 
label2 What do you want  Sheldon ?
label2 I want that too  Why are you here ?
label2 Thank you  that's very comforting 
label2 It's not ?
label2 You're right  I do feel better 
label2 You're my surrogate family ?
label2 Are you guys drunk ?
label2 Wait a minute  what are you talking about ? What inappropriate behaviour ?
label2 What the hell  agreed 
label2 Mother  remember when I was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough ?
label2 I'm over it 
label2 Look at us  Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they're our girlfriends 
label2 Howard  artificial women are your department  You want to take this ?
label2 What are you trying to tell me  Howard ?
label2 Don't worry  We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar 
label2 Got it 
label2 Uh  sorry  Raj  Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette 
label2 How did we get actual women ?
label2 I hope you're hungry  Bernadette  we're going to a terrific restaurant 
label2 Great  How come ?
label2 Of course  I would never make fun of you 
label2 Oh  gee  why didn't you say so ? They don't let just anyone have a Web site 
label2 You're surprised ? Your psychic didn't tell you I was going to be a jerk ?
label2 I'm sorry  but facts are facts 
label2 You're welcome  How's your fish ?
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 Maybe we should just stop talking about this 
label2 You know  the best thing about being in a committed  monogamous  mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas  you can have a spirited debate  yet still care for  even make love with '
label2 What the hell is eighth base ?
label2 Oh  couldn't be better 
label2 It's not just Cylons  Superman's next 
label2 How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics ?
label2 And that didn't bother you ?
label2 What am I supposed to do  pretend I believe something I don't whenever I'm with Penny ?
label2 Do me a favour  lean over  put your head right here 
label2 What's your point ? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny  I have to give up everything I believe in  my intellectual integrity  the very nature of who I am ? I can't do that  Howard 
label2 What is that ?
label2 Hey  Cleaning out the old dryer lint  huh ? Not only is it courteous  it's safety smart  Every year  15000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition  Now you're supposed to say  wow  what an interesting fact  Come here  you crazy  nerdy guy  I could never be mad at you 
label2 No  I'm sorry  I really am  It's not right to mock what a person believes in 
label2 Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds ?
label2 Okay  let's go see your psychic 
label2 No  not at all  Let me help you with this stuff 
label2 I know  and pyramid power and healing crystals 
label2 Really  that's the line ? Psychics are real  but crystals are voodoo ?
label2 It's obviously a typo 
label2 And why is that ?
label2 What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes ?
label2 We like games 
label2 What about me ?
label2 Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him ?
label2 How is that going to help them ?
label2 What are we supposed to do now ?
label2 Hey  there's no reason for you to be scared 
label2 Hand me the bat 
label2 We're fine  Sheldon 
label2 Yes  we are  And we're about to go to bed 
label2 What do you want ?
label2 It's getting scary here  too 
label2 Did we win ? Can we go to bed ?
label2 He's right  Penny  It's all there 
label2 Great  Good night 
label2 Just keep walking 
label2 Who is it ?
label2 I'll send them a basket of muffins 
label2 Where did you get all this stuff ?
label2 He just gave it to you ?
label2 Sorry  let me help you 
label2 God  Sheldon  What the hell are you doing out there ?
label2 We were going to have '
label2 Great  you do that 
label2 Sorry about that 
label2 Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction ?
label2 Oh  no  he's going to telecommute  Everybody's really excited about it 
label2 Any place specific or just the Bozeman  Montana Loony Bin ?
label2 They call themselves Bozites ?
label2 Penny  I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment 
label2 Mmm  he's either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually  or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off 
label2 Aye  aye  Captain 
label2 Maybe you need a fresh start 
label2 No  I think it's a firmware problem 
label2 I think Penny likes to skate  The four of us could double 
label2 Yeah  this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant 
label2 Here  you want my peas ?
label2 So roller skating  should we all grab a bite to eat first ?
label2 You had some nice moves out there  Howard 
label2 Yeah  Did you notice all the people looking at us ?
label2 Don't tell Koothrappali  After you 
label2 Oh  my God ! Are you '
label2 Are you okay ?
label2 Don't bark at me  I fell  too 
label2 No  that's a crazy thing 
label2 That was amazing how you handled him 
label2 It's not me  it's my new ringtone  The Joker from Batman 
label2 Me  too  but I paid three bucks for it 
label2 Hello  Yeah  I'm Leonard Hofstadter  Yeah  yeah  he's my roommate  Oh  God  is he okay ? Yeah  alright  alright  I'll be right there 
label2 Hi  I'm Dr  Hofstadter  Where is he ?
label2 Thanks for not calling the cops 
label2 Yeah  well  he's extra special  Hey  Shelly  What you doing ?
label2 No  I don't think so  We need to go home now 
label2 For God's sakes  Sheldon  come here !
label2 And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night ?
label2 Because we didn't want to be disturbed 
label2 Really ? You figured out the graphene problem ?
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 Keep going 
label2 So  you're going to go work at the patent office ?
label2 Sounds like a great plan 
label2 Told you 
label2 No cilantro ?
label2 Lettuce shredded  not chopped ?
label2 You understand why I'm doing this to you ?
label2 That'll be all  That was fun 
label2 I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down  bought a van  and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer 
label2 Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg's shih tzu 
label2 Oh  I used to be like that  Then I got a girlfriend 
label2 Hey  what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine's Day ?
label2 Okay  so to sum up : one giant marble horse  one asinine comment  one lonely man and his chicken  And let's see  who's left ? Oh  that's right  My plans  Isn't anyone going to ask ?
label2 That's not what I was going to tell you 
label2 Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14 ?
label2 Actually  Professor Norton can't make it  He threw his back out rock climbing 
label2 In any case  they're asking me to fill in for him 
label2 Switzerland  And I get to bring a guest !
label2 I am taking Penny 
label2 Sheldon  you got a minute ?
label2 Sheldon  I'm not taking you to Switzerland 
label2 Yes  but it'll be Valentine's Day  We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps 
label2 I'm sorry  Sheldon 
label2 Yeah  well  I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl since I was six 
label2 No  But it does involve air travel  Okay  um  let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife  and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 How does that involve air travel ?
label2 We're going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider ! And ski  We'll also go skiing 
label2 Well  you'll ski  I'll fall  but  yeah  we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day 
label2 Sheldon  we've been through this  I'm taking Penny 
label2 Not the roommate agreement 
label2 Oh  for God's sakes 
label2 Yeah  We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant  or if one of us gets superpowers  or if one of us is bitten by a zombie 
label2 Sheldon  do you really expect to enforce this ?
label2 Look  Sheldon  I know it's in the agreement  and if you turn into a zombie  I promise I will not kill you  In fact  I'll even let you eat my brains  But I am taking Penny to Switzerland 
label2 What do you think ?
label2 Got a bit of traffic this morning  huh ? Think it's gonna rain ? Instead of underpants  I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning  Thoughts ? Okay  I know what'll cheer you up  let's play one of your driving games 
label2 You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas ?
label2 Come on  Sheldon  Can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me ?
label2 Rupert Murdoch ?
label2 You seen Sheldon ?
label2 Yeah  He thinks I betrayed him  I mean  come on  what would you guys do if you were me ?
label2 Seriously ?
label2 Uh  let's see  Yup  30 pieces of silverware 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 You made Frodo pancakes ?
label2 Why are you doing this ?
label2 Thanks  It's good 
label2 You hate Babylon 5 
label2 Okay  great  Still not taking you to Switzerland 
label2 Some what ?
label2 You're not going to Switzerland !
label2 She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her 
label2 Well  forget it  I was the one who was invited  I get to decide who goes with me  and it's Penny  not you !
label2 I don't need to see your presentation  This discussion is over !
label2 Sheldon  at this point  I would go by myself before I would take you 
label2 I'm sorry you feel that way 
label2 Just think  this time tomorrow we'll be in Geneva  Switzerland for our first Valentine's Day 
label2 Do you want an allergy pill ? ' Cause I have ' em all  Prescription  nonprescription  foreign  domestic  experimental 
label2 Not really  I'm just an enthusiast 
label2 Penny ? You okay ?
label2 What's going on ?
label2 Hey  Sheldon ? Listen  Penny is pretty sick and she's not going to be able to go to Switzerland  So if you're still interested  you're welcome to come 
label2 Yeah  I forgot about all this 
label2 Will you please turn your shirt off ?
label2 Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease 
label2 I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83  first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five  first appearance of Dr  Doom 
label2 He does  And in the kitchen  And in the car  And in his pocket 
label2 Hey  Guess who's going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday ?
label2 Stan Lee 
label2 No  no  Stan Lee 
label2 You have no idea who he is  do you ?
label2 Good  good  so  who's Stan Lee ?
label2 That's Bruce Lee 
label2 Whoa ! What do you mean all ?
label2 Yeah  okay  No 
label2 That's what I'm saying 
label2 Oh  come on  why would you do that ?
label2 For what ?
label2 So tell him to apologize 
label2 Oh  no  that's terrible  Ooh  the line's moving  Got to go  Bye 
label2 Look at that  To my friend  Leonard  from Stan Lee  Excelsior !
label2 Oh  hey  buddy  How'd it go ?
label2 Okay  that's enough  Howard  The poor guy's had a tough time  He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit 
label2 Except for Raj 
label2 Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff ?
label2 One more floor  and I'd be the pulled muscle 
label2 Uh  well  we didn't actually get Chinese food 
label2 Don't panic  this is better 
label2 Anyway  we followed the guy to this garage sale  and they had the coolest stuff 
label2 We didn't even get to go through it all  There could be anything in here 
label2 No  But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains !
label2 Ooh  look  an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots 
label2 And in the darkness bind them 
label2 Seedy underbelly ?
label2 No  it is not yours  We all went in on the box together 
label2 How is this maritime salvage ?
label2 We are not blackmailing Peter J ' All right  where's the ring ?
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Give me that 
label2 You always get your way 
label2 This ring 
label2 How am I looking now ?
label2 We're not giving him two Jet Skis 
label2 No Jet Skis 
label2 You know what ? I am ending this  Penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore  She gave it to me  I have it  I'm sending it back  Where's the ring ?
label2 Give me that 
label2 Okay  now  this is ridiculous !
label2 I'm not letting go  you let go 
label2 Fine  But can't we go home and start this ?
label2 All right  it starts now 
label2 And it wasn't when we were driving like this ?
label2 You want to talk about endless patience ? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City 
label2 Oh  crap !
label2 Thank you 
label2 I'm out 
label2 It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from 
label2 Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand  It wasn't ours 
label2 I came in here  you guys were all sleeping  The ring was on the floor  No one was touching it 
label2 There wasn't ever going to be a winner  There was going to be a selfish  petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend  Is that really what you guys want ? ' Cause if it is  fine  I don't want anything to do with you  And I don't know what happened in that bathroom  but I am not cleaning it up !
label2 NEVER !
label2 Oh  I'm so glad you asked it like that  You 
label2 You won 
label2 Hey  you didn't want a Slurpee at 7 - Eleven  you don't get glasses 
label2 What  to you  is a large crowd ?
label2 Sheldon  you're being ridiculous 
label2 Sheldon ? Sheldon  are you okay ?
label2 Sit down  we want to talk to you 
label2 We think we can help you with your stage fright 
label2 Yeah  we watched it last week  You said you liked it 
label2 I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety 
label2 My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist  and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently 
label2 How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale ?
label2 Why don't we just talk ?
label2 But it could be part of your problem  Let me give you an example  When I was eight  I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project  ' Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music  ' But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier ' Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ' n ' Roll  ' I felt so guilty  I gave the ribbon back 
label2 Terrible  I worked really hard on that project  I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout 
label2 It wasn't my fault  I had never seen my brother's project  And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone 
label2 Damn right  I'm angry with my mother  For God's sake  I was eight years old  She humiliated me  That's when the bed-wetting started again 
label2 Wait  that's it ? I thought we had a whole hour !
label2 You might want to check YouTube 
label2 It's already loaded  Just hit play 
label2 Uh-uh  give it a minute 
label2 No  no  I'm good  If my P  E  teachers had told me this is what I was training for  I would have tried a lot harder 
label2 Oh  my God  I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda  I love you  Penny 
label2 Good  Glad is good 
label2 Yeah  probably 
label2 Good night 
label2 Seriously ? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants ?
label2 I honestly don't care 
label2 What do you want from me ? I just don't give a rat's ass 
label2 Can we please talk about something else ? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet ?
label2 No  there was no spat 
label2 I don't want to talk about it 
label2 What ? No 
label2 I'm walking away from you now 
label2 Oh  hey 
label2 You don't have to come if you don't want to 
label2 Get into what ? Why wouldn't you love the chilli cheese fries ? They've been in your life a long time  They make you happy  They deserve to know 
label2 Okay  well  now you've had some time to think about it  So  what do you want to say ?
label2 How can you not be sure ?
label2 No  the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said  I love you  and you said  Thank you  good night 
label2 I am not pushing anything 
label2 What ? No  it's okay  We don't have to talk ' cause there's nothing to talk about  Everything's good 
label2 All right  maybe I overreacted  So we're in two different places emotionally  So what ? And maybe I'm a little ahead of you  That's fine  You know  In fact  it makes sense  ' cause let's face it  I've been in this relationship two years longer than you 
label2 Really ? I wouldn't know what that's like 
label2 Yeah  I do 
label2 Yes  that's what I'm telling you  We are good  We are great 
label2 Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek 
label2 This is fun  huh ?
label2 It's good that we got out and did something physical 
label2 Mm-hmm  and someday  we don't know when  maybe you'll love me back  Ooh  I'm up 
label2 Penny  you're up 
label2 We really need a strike here 
label2 So just take your time and concentrate 
label2 I'm not pressuring you 
label2 Okay  I'm sorry  I'll shut up 
label2 No  let her go 
label2 I'm pretty sure it's already over 
label2 No  no  it's fine  I don't care  I'm over it 
label2 Sheldon  I got you your tangerine chicken  I hope you're hungry 
label2 I don't know  Why ?
label2 Do you want the last dumpling  Sheldon ?
label2 So  you guys want to do something tonight ?
label2 What about you  Raj ?
label2 You know what ? I'll just spend the evening alone 
label2 Since when do you take after-dinner walks ?
label2 Where you going with this  Raj ?
label2 So  go 
label2 And you think my presence will help with that ?
label2 I'm not going out tonight  Raj 
label2 Very much 
label2 Don't worry  You'll meet a girl someday 
label2 Yes  you will  and she'll be beautiful  and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman 
label2 I do  and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart  And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic  little pieces 
label2 I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big  fat Japanese guys 
label2 Hey  where you been ?
label2 For an hour and a half ?
label2 How could you get lost ? Your phone has GPS 
label2 What the hell was that about ?
label2 Oh  we really need to get you a girl 
label2 Oh  just come in !
label2 What do you want  Sheldon ?
label2 Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you 
label2 What do you want ?
label2 I'm in bed !
label2 Sheldon !
label2 Okay  when you say seeing Penny  what exactly does that mean ?
label2 Fine  Why did you have dinner with Penny ?
label2 Is it possible he said Bros before Hos ?
label2 Sheldon  I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny 
label2 I guess not 
label2 You used to it yet ?
label2 His mother ?
label2 I was going to do that 
label2 No  I don't want to do it  You can do it 
label2 You're taking him to Disneyland ?
label2 All right  But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food  I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste 
label2 And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats  He'll say he can handle it  but I promise you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes 
label2 Yeah  don't let Goofy near him  He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it 
label2 Wish I knew  He's fine with Pluto 
label2 It's ten o'clock  where have you been ?
label2 I was going to see that with him 
label2 And I have food here  You said you were going to call 
label2 We're not fighting 
label2 Want a cup of coffee ?
label2 Come on  It's just a cup of coffee 
label2 What am I smelling ?
label2 Yeah  Shame he has to wake up 
label2 Smother Sheldon in his sleep ? Wouldn't that be wrong ?
label2 Oh  Sure  Absolutely 
label2 Here's an idea  I'm just throwing it out there  friends who have sex 
label2 Kidding  Just a couple of friends goofin ' around 
label2 When you say non-related female  you still mean human  right ?
label2 Okay  fine  Where is she going to sleep ?
label2 Thank you  Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel ?
label2 I can't believe he's friends with Elizabeth Plimpton 
label2 She's here  she's here  How do I look ? Do I look smart ?
label2 Oh  I have so many things to tell your biographer 
label2 Hi-lo  Oops  I started to say hi  and then I switched to hello in the middle  It came out hi-lo  Duh  Uh  it's nice to meet you  I've read both your books and most of your papers  I'm Leonard  I live
label2 Well  who wants to stay in a hotel ? With windows that don't open  those crazy card-shaped keys 
label2 Well  I understand  too 
label2 Uh  sleep night  I mean  obviously  good night  I started to say sleep tight  then I changed my mind in the middle  I swear to God  I'm smart 
label2 Is everything all right ?
label2 Me neither  Oh  look what I'm reading  It's you 
label2 I did  but it's been a while  and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast 
label2 Oh  good  Wasn't sure it was coming across 
label2 Uh  six 
label2 Really ? Uh  sure doesn't read that way 
label2 Wow  You really make science come alive 
label2 Morning  Sheldon 
label2 How do you take your coffee ?
label2 Okeydoke 
label2 Something his mother taught him 
label2 Okay  well  I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work  You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend  Dr  Plimpton  who you just met  It'll be fun  Like a clown car 
label2 What  uh  you and me ? Yeah  we did  Not too long ago  How are you doing with it ?
label2 Come on  It wasn't my fault 
label2 Penny  I can still drive you 
label2 I didn't betray Penny 
label2 How am I betraying you ?
label2 Yeah  I guess I did 
label2 You still have a cold ?
label2 Are you having trouble sleeping ? ' Cause  boy  I was up all night 
label2 No  but I was awake all night 
label2 No  that's okay  It was something else keeping me up last night  And again this morning  And  I didn't mind  I was up last night  I was up this morning  I didn't mind  Those are your clues 
label2 Okay  I'll give you one more clue  It involved another person 
label2 Hey  you 
label2 Boy  I'm kind of tuckered out  How are you feeling  Elizabeth ?
label2 Coming right up 
label2 Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting ?
label2 We'll all be naked in front of each other 
label2 I thought we had something special 
label2 Thanks  It's really hard to find these in his size  So  listen  I've been meaning to talk to you about the other morning 
label2 Yeah  I wanted to explain 
label2 I don't ?
label2 Leonard 
label2 Can I sleep on your couch tonight ?
label2 You heard that  huh ?
label2 So you agree  he's nuts 
label2 Believe it or not  he was worse when I met him 
label2 nard : Excuse me  I'm looking for Sheldon Cooper's apartment 
label2 nard : What ?
label2 For all I knew  he was the crazy one  He had this really deranged look 
label2 Sure  it makes sense now 
label2 nard : Dr  Cooper ?
label2 In retrospect  that was clue number two 
label2 nard : I'm Leonard Hofstadter  I called you about the apartment  You said '
label2 nard : What ?
label2 nard : Uh  radon ?
label2 nard : I don't understand  their  their existence is conditional ?
label2 nard : Okay 
label2 nard : What's the difference ?
label2 nard : Can you do that ?
label2 nard : What is that ?
label2 nard : Yes 
label2 nard : A car  yeah 
label2 nard : Well  can't you drive ?
label2 nard : Come on  I just asked 
label2 nard : Uh  I guess 
label2 nard : Fine  I'll take it 
label2 nard : Is this it ?
label2 nard : So where do you sleep ?
label2 nard : On occasion 
label2 nard : We have a flag ?
label2 It was the best apartment I'd seen  the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way 
label2 Okay  how about this ? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over 
label2 nard : Shh  Just pretend we're not here 
label2 nard : I'm sure he'll go away 
label2 nard : What do you want ? I didn't say come in !
label2 nard : But  Joyce  come on 
label2 Do I get some sympathy now ?
label2 Actually  I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim 
label2 Well  I was doing some government research at the time  you know  military  rocket fuel  It's kind of secret 
label2 As it turns out  she was a North Korean spy  Luckily  Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important  Which I'm not saying I would have 
label2 That was part of it  The other part is what happened with the elevator 
label2 It was  but one night  Sheldon came home from work '
label2 nard : Hey  Sheldon  This is Howard and Raj  They work at the university  too 
label2 nard : Oh  well  there were some people on the first floor moving out  and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars  Howard and Raj helped me bring it up 
label2 nard : They're lawn chairs  And there was no place for company 
label2 nard : According to the roommate agreement  I'm entitled to allocate 50 % of the cubic footage of the common areas 
label2 nard : What am I doing in your spam folder ?
label2 nard : Ooh  it's time for Babylon 5 !
label2 nard : Why not ?
label2 nard : I like it 
label2 nard : There you go ' three against one 
label2 nard : But I said no to that 
label2 Hey  do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not ?
label2 nard : That your dad ?
label2 nard : Oh  man  Is that a two-stage rocket ?
label2 Well  it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment 
label2 Mm  Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living  and I was going to kind of show it to her  It's not important  The point is  the guys and I went back to the apartment 
label2 Yeah  we're really close  Uh  uh  we're at the apartment 
label2 nard : Excuse me  but I've been working on this a long time  Trust me  it'll work 
label2 nard : There's no mistake 
label2 nard : Well  I've adjusted the formula 
label2 nard : A bad thing  A very bad thing  Get the door  Get the door ! Get the door ! Get the door ! Get the door !
label2 Not only did Sheldon save my life  he didn't rat me out to the landlord  Or the police  Or Homeland Security 
label2 Oh  uh  clear nail polish  I had a mani-pedi  Men can get those  Anyway  I may owe you an apology 
label2 I did agree to the thermostat setting  and I shouldn't have tried to change it 
label2 Okay  I'm sorry 
label2 So  we're good ?
label2 Never mind  Okay if I watch some TV ?
label2 Okay  we've got power to the laser 
label2 What for ? It's not going to rain 
label2 Relax  it's just a dirty sock 
label2 Sheldon  the world is filled with dirty discarded socks 
label2 Hey  you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment ? Penny 
label2 I don't know  it's still a little weird since  you know '
label2 She didn't dump me  We were just in different places in the relationship 
label2 We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon 
label2 It's pretty cool  We've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything  I thought you might want to see it 
label2 Oh  sorry  I didn't know you were busy  Maybe another time 
label2 Okay  well  yeah  come on up  So  how'd you two guys meet ?
label2 So  menus 
label2 Let me explain what we're doing here  Um  in 1969  the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon  and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier 
label2 The laser ?
label2 Uh  that's a great question  Zack 
label2 Don't worry about the moon  We  we set our laser to stun 
label2 25 seconds for the light to return  That's the moon ! We hit the moon !
label2 Yeah  but  uh  think about what this represents  The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon  put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane 
label2 Why not ?
label2 I'll help you 
label2 Coming !
label2 Are you drunk ?
label2 How did I ruin him ?
label2 Come on  he wasn't that stupid 
label2 Okay  yeah  he's stupid 
label2 How is that my fault ?
label2 Why ? I mean  okay 
label2 How many times have I asked you not to do that ?
label2 Where's Penny ?
label2 I wonder why she didn't say good-bye 
label2 I know  I just thought as an outsider  you might be able to provide a fresh perspective 
label2 Oh  hey 
label2 Okay  I'll walk down with you  So  last night was fun  huh ?
label2 Bummer  Anyway  I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie 
label2 Doesn't have to be tonight  I'm free pretty much always 
label2 No  it's pretty well imprinted on my brain  Especially the whole rodeo thing 
label2 So  that's it ? Wham  bam  thank you  Leonard ?
label2 How am I supposed to let it go ? You used me for sex ! Morning  Mrs  Gunderson 
label2 Great  Maybe she can have sex with him  and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do ?
label2 I don't want to talk about it 
label2 If she can do it  I can do it  If she can do it  I can do it  If she can do it  I can do it 
label2 Oh  hi  Hey  Hi  Leslie 
label2 Uh  I know ! It's been a while !
label2 Right  Right  So how you doing ?
label2 Uh  not bad  You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything  it was just for fun ?
label2 Uh  do you  uh  want to do that again ?
label2 She didn't dump me  We were just in different places in the relationship 
label2 Um  anyway  apparently  it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them 
label2 So  what do you say ?
label2 She's not coming back 
label2 Thirty feet 
label2 I was a perfectly happy  geeky  little lonely guy  and you ruined me !
label2 Alright 
label2 I don't think that's going to happen  Sheldon 
label2 So how's work ?
label2 His girlfriend 
label2 Four months 
label2 Wait a minute ' a child ? You never see this girl  You just e-mail and text and Twitter  Now you're considering having a baby ?
label2 Still digging the Shamy ?
label2 I'd suggest a lubricant  but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well 
label2 Okay  let's see 
label2 How about an acetylene torch ?
label2 Well  then what do you want us to do ?
label2 Okay  come on  Almost there 
label2 Uh  it's what controls the arm 
label2 Yeah  yeah  great  Howard  uh  slow down  What do you mean it happened again ?
label2 Whatcha doin ' there ? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner ?
label2 How's that ?
label2 You can always get a badger and find out 
label2 That long  huh ?
label2 What's there ?
label2 So  you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot ?
label2 Tough break  You want eggs ?
label2 Is somebody working on that ?
label2 Wait a minute  You hate dogs 
label2 It came to $ 2817  Let's say six bucks apiece 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Never mind  I got it 
label2 It's no big deal 
label2 How can you walk around with no money ?
label2 It's okay  you can owe me 
label2 Sheldon  six bucks 
label2 No  no  don't ask 
label2 There's no cholera in Pasadena  Just like last summer  when there was no malaria in Pasadena 
label2 When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms ?
label2 Have you had your appendix out ?
label2 Let's get you to the hospital 
label2 Funny how things work out  isn't it ?
label2 Good night 
label2 Palak paneer  that's Penny 
label2 And for Rajesh Koothrappali  from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate  one large order of chicken McNuggets 
label2 Uh  12 bucks 
label2 Well  okay  with the Indian food  the pizza  the Thai food  the tank of gas  the frozen yogurt and your rent  uh  a little over fourteen hundred dollars 
label2 Sheldon  are you gonna join us ?
label2 Greetings  whatever the hell you are 
label2 This is ridiculous  I'm coming to talk to you 
label2 Sheldon  this is ridiculous 
label2 At the hands of your roommate ?
label2 No  it's not 
label2 I'll be damned 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 I don't want to listen to music  Sheldon 
label2 Except in Knight Rider  the car isn't a yammering sphincter 
label2 I was wrong  this is exactly like Knight Rider 
label2 That's it  Bye-bye 
label2 I'm still going to go with you 
label2 What about it ?
label2 No  I think a doorknob has you stymied 
label2 Why are you introducing yourself ?
label2 I think it is 
label2 Penny  Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer  He and Steve Jobs started it '
label2 Of course you must 
label2 What the hell are you guys playing ?
label2 All right  I like a good brainteaser  Give it a whirl 
label2 Uh  a BLT where the B stands for beaver ? I don't know 
label2 I can figure this out  let's see  Um  well  beavers eat tree bark  The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon  So  I'll say cinnamon 
label2 I'm going to my room 
label2 Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids ? It's pretty interesting  This guy's working from a hypothesis where '
label2 Okay  that's all I got  Howard  you're up 
label2 Got it 
label2 Yeah  not my point 
label2 Okay  let me just get right to it  Amy is judgmental  sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious 
label2 So we already have you for all that 
label2 Well  he pointed out that he kinda  sorta had to put up with you 
label2 I tried  but
label2 I assume by never again  you mean never again will you drink all of Penny's beer  then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s  a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks 
label2 Oh  no 
label2 John and Yoko 
label2 No  I mean since the Shamy hit a reef 
label2 Uh  went splitsville 
label2 Turned to boom-boom 
label2 He got a cat to keep him company 
label2 He takes it everywhere  to bed  to the bathroom 
label2 So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project ?
label2 Zazzles ?
label2 Okay  we need to talk 
label2 Cats  Sheldon  You're clearly upset about Amy being gone  and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats 
label2 Okay  yeah  fine 
label2 Terrific  My-my point is you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup 
label2 Okay  I got it  I got it  she's not your girlfriend  Now listen to me  I know about loneliness  I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff  When I broke up with Penny  I got back into my cello  I built a bunch of model rockets  I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell 
label2 She didn't dump me  It was mutual !
label2 Okay  fine  Live with cats  Be like my Aunt Nancy  She had dozens of them  And do you know what happened after she died ? They ate her 
label2 Hi  Mrs  Cooper  Thanks for coming 
label2 No  she's real 
label2 Hold on to that thought 
label2 Surprise 
label2 Hang on a second  I could have the fruit platter 
label2 No  I can't eat melon 
label2 When was the last time you saw her ?
label2 You know  you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette 
label2 That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy  Oh  my God  You ran over a hobo 
label2 All right  fine  So you want to get back together with her  but you're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did 
label2 Okay  Well  how about this ? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you 
label2 Why can't he have a desk  Sheldon ?
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm ?
label2 So anyway  Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette  and she did  and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee 
label2 I don't know  Sometimes your movements are so lifelike  I forget you're not a real boy 
label2 Oh  congratulations  Have you broken it to the troll yet ?
label2 Ah  Well  I guess for you guys that's like regular golf 
label2 Yeah  and don't you forget it 
label2 Oh  God  what's that smell ?
label2 What are you doing in there ?
label2 Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulphide gas ?
label2 All I'm saying is  if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie  they could probably just make an actual Hulk 
label2 Got it 
label2 No  no  Maybe a little 
label2 Jealousy ? What do I have to be jealous of ?
label2 Oh  right  That 
label2 I'm not jealous 
label2 Probably  What's your point ?
label2 Hmm  recently ? Not much 
label2 Um  shut up 
label2 That sounds lovely 
label2 Sheldon  I'm just not dating someone right now  I don't need to go to a senior centre 
label2 Fine  If I don't meet someone soon  you can put me in a home 
label2 Hey  guys 
label2 You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend  and we don't 
label2 ' who's a friend 
label2 What about you  Stuart ? You have a girlfriend yet ?
label2 Why don't you just break up with her ?
label2 Why not ?
label2 Because I don't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends  I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own 
label2 You're saying I couldn't get laid in a women's prison with a handful of pardons 
label2 I don't know  Maybe 
label2 Thank you 
label2 That was two hours ago 
label2 No  I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar 
label2 Yeah  what ?
label2 Well  you know how you're always saying that Amy is a girl who's your friend  and not your girlfriend ?
label2 You can't say that anymore 
label2 Look  she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level 
label2 Well  have you considered telling her how you feel ?
label2 All right  well  let me see if I can explain your situation using physics  What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis ?
label2 There you go 
label2 The volcano thing ? No 
label2 No  it's just something I threw on 
label2 It was going well  I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode  The manager got suspicious  and  well  long story short  they really do have a little jail in the mall 
label2 I want to invoke the girlfriend pact  Howard 
label2 No  I just  I want what you have  You know  I want a woman in my life 
label2 To be clear  I meant like Bernadette  not your mother 
label2 Well  I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend  How do I look ?
label2 What are you working on ?
label2 The old Unabomber approach  Kudos 
label2 What if she just comes over ?
label2 You changed the address on the building ? What about mail ?
label2 She's been here before 
label2 What do you want to do ?
label2 Okay  where are you ?
label2 Hi  Amy  Sheldon's not here 
label2 Thanks again for doing this  Bernadette 
label2 Yeah  So  Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes ?
label2 Wow  Wouldn't think there'd be that many 
label2 Should be  it's thirty dollars a pound 
label2 Or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off  There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet  Look  Howard  I appreciate the effort  but this is  like  the worst date of my life 
label2 I guess the difference is  I have some self-respect 
label2 It's relatively new  I just know that I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like simply to have a girlfriend  I'm okay on my own 
label2 Look  uh  Joy  it was nice to meet you  but '
label2 You're asking me out ?
label2 I look forward to it 
label2 Problem ?
label2 The hope has been that you'd eventually bend to public opinion  So  Priya  what brings you back to LA ?
label2 And your poll numbers just keep dropping 
label2 I'm going too  I'll show you where it is 
label2 Yeah  It's good to see you too  Here you go 
label2 So  uh  Priya  what are your plans while you're here 
label2 It's getting pretty late  how come you're still up ?
label2 You've really got to get out more 
label2 Yeah  well 
label2 Yeah  he does but he got caught up in a computer game and '
label2 If the past is any indication  no 
label2 Drop axe 
label2 Give me a minute  Sheldon 
label2 Sheldon  you need to work in the morning 
label2 Well then  bed mister 
label2 Really ? You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar ? You know what happens when you yawn in public 
label2 Oh  uh  building manager  They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two 
label2 No  no  it doesn't matter  we'll be at work 
label2 Bifurcated uvula  Sheldon !
label2 No  no  no  no  no  You just need  you just need  you just need to map it out  Come on  I'll help you  So  uh  you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times ?
label2 You're right  you're lost  good luck 
label2 Huh ! Sorry !
label2 I don't know  When I'm in bed with a girl  it's just  it's my go to response 
label2 Oh  right  sure  I wish you could stay in LA a while longer 
label2 Well  I'm just saying  I don't have any real ties here  so if I were to move to New Delhi we could  you know  go out 
label2 Well  yes  but  things have changed  you know  you're older  I'm older  Look  no more superhero bedsheets 
label2 It doesn't ?
label2 I'm not that white  My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee  I know that's not the right kind of Indian but it is something 
label2 Oh  uh  yeah  I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman 
label2 Air freshener 
label2 Uh  rash  that's a bad rash 
label2 Uh  yeah  yeah  that sounds great 
label2 Without 
label2 Fine  With 
label2 Use your best judgement 
label2 Sounds great 
label2 Making pretty good time  huh ?
label2 Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister 
label2 No-one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister 
label2 Like what ?
label2 Priya and I are both adults  We didn't betray Raj 
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 Okay  fine  I betrayed Howard 
label2 Alright  and Raj 
label2 My point is  Priya's gone  And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this 
label2 You can if you try  Think about it this way  if I were Batman and you were Alfred  you'd keep that secret  Right ?
label2 Because  well  Batman has the secret 
label2 Like what ?
label2 Kind of busy here  Sheldon 
label2 What do you want 
label2 What alibi ?
label2 Oh  I'm so sure I'm going to regret this  but  who was I with ?
label2 Oh  God 
label2 Where did you get that ?
label2 An orang-u-tan ?
label2 Sheldon  I don't need an alibi  Nobody's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip 
label2 C'mon Raj  how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to  Or was attracted to  Or who she might be attracted to  In the future 
label2 I didn't see it 
label2 Uh  I was out 
label2 Yeah  I  uh  went for a drink 
label2 To  uh  Lucky Baldwin's 
label2 As a matter of fact I  I ' I can't ' I can't ' I can't do it 
label2 Look  I'm sorry Raj  but the truth is I was with Priya last night 
label2 No  no  no  would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it 
label2 Very hard 
label2 Really ?
label2 You put moths in my food ?
label2 Well  uh  I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush 
label2 Okay  I  I  I think it's safe to say that we've all done some things we're not particularly proud of  But come on  we're friends  Friends overlook each other's minor lapses  For the record  Howard  I'm sorry that I broke our pact 
label2 These are pretty god  what flavour is this ?
label2 Papaya ?
label2 I give up 
label2 No  seriously  I think I've finally figured out my problem with women 
label2 My problem is  I don't project confidence  So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive  rather than holding back and being cautious  I'm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance 
label2 Hi  I'm Leonard  And you are beautiful  You pop  sparkle and buzz electric  I'm going to pick you up at eight  show you a night you will never forget 
label2 Congratulations Howard 
label2 Why not ?
label2 Don't be ridiculous  Raj  You're here legally 
label2 Fine  Sheldon  tell us about your giant rodents 
label2 So  when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me  I was expecting Mulder  Glad to see I got Scully 
label2 Mulder and Scully  X-Files  The truth is out there  Never mind  Uh  so  what would you like to know ?
label2 Yes  Of course  we're in different departments  He's an engineer and I'm an experimental physicist  You know  one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says  Hello  maker of the universe  I see what you did there  Good one 
label2 Good  It's a good relationship  Of course  most of my relationships are good  Probably because I exude confidence  People are drawn to that  you know ? Confidence  not exuding 
label2 You are beautiful  you know that ? You pop  sparkle and buzz electric  I'm going to pick you up at eight  show you a night you will never forget 
label2 Really ?
label2 Is that  oh  my  I didn't see the ring with my glasses off  so  look at that  I'm starting to exude 
label2 Want to get that ?
label2 Could you get that ?
label2 Would you please get that ?
label2 To tell you the truth  I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard  it'd be Sheldon 
label2 What are you doing up ?
label2 I'm sorry  Why can't you sleep ?
label2 Did something happen today that's bothering you ?
label2 Because you feel guilty ?
label2 You're having a guilt-ridden dream 
label2 How about that Gorn sitting on the couch ?
label2 94 seconds 
label2 I can't believe you've never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark 
label2 When she comes out with Eat  Pray  Run Away From A Giant Boulder  I'll read it 
label2 Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track ?
label2 Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing  we'd still be together 
label2 Relax  it's five o'clock  The movie doesn't start till midnight 
label2 Oh  Well  he waited in line for 14 hours  while you napped in a lawn chair  he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him  and worst of all  he saw Star Trek : Nemesis 
label2 Thank you  Amy 
label2 Guys  that's really starting to get old 
label2 Hysterical !
label2 Who's there ?
label2 Hugh who ?
label2 So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner 
label2 What's a stadium pal ?
label2 Nice going  Raj  just got him down for his nap 
label2 It's fine  it's fine  Go back to sleep 
label2 Calm down  Sheldon 
label2 Had to wake him up from his nap  didn't you ?
label2 Why do you read his Twitter feed ? You know it's only going to upset you 
label2 We really want to see this  Is there anything you can do ?
label2 Short Round ?
label2 Yeah  I know who it is  but why is it me ?
label2 What is that ?
label2 Sheldon  this is crazy 
label2 Listen to me  You are over-tired  You're not thinking right  Put the movie back before we get into trouble 
label2 He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing ?
label2 I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food 
label2 Oh  um  is Penny here ?
label2 Okay  I think a bit of context here might help 
label2 Oh  good  Context 
label2 You'll never guess what just happened 
label2 She introduced me to her father  kissed me and then shut the door in my face 
label2 Penny kissing me is not insane  She used to kiss me all the time 
label2 I'm just saying  it felt like it may have meant something 
label2 Why do I bother talking to you people ?
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 What  uh  the kissing and everything ? Nah  women do that to me all the time 
label2 What kind of guys did you used to go out with ?
label2 Really ? How  how'd we manage that ?
label2 Well  did you apologize ? Did you have to woo me ?
label2 Yeah  no  I don't think so 
label2 I'm just saying  if we fake got back together  that's totally not how it fake happened 
label2 Hold on  you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing ? Cause I'm good with that 
label2 See ? He doesn't mind 
label2 Uh  I do  I have to work  But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father  ' cause  you know  just the kind of boyfriend I am 
label2 Come here  you 
label2 Thanks for the steak  Wyatt 
label2 A lot of people are doing that 
label2 Thanks  Wyatt  I'm a keeper 
label2 Maybe I could go in a little late 
label2 Don't I know it 
label2 Good night  Wyatt  Oh  good night  honey 
label2 Coming  Hey  lovebug 
label2 You got to admit  I am  I'm delightful 
label2 It's not difficult for me  I'm having fun 
label2 What do you want me to do ? You started this  Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up ?
label2 Well  then  what do you want ?
label2 Don't you think that's something you should have figured out before you stomped over here ?
label2 I have a list  FYI  overuse of the phrase  oh  my god  is number 12 
label2 Ba-ba-ba-ba  Are you sure you want to include him in this ?
label2 Fines ?
label2 Oh  b-be careful  Give him some line  Okay  now reel him in 
label2 Yeah  They do that when you set it on easy 
label2 Hey  baby  I love you ! Mwuh  mwuh  mwuh  mwuh  mwuh 
label2 Oh  hey  There's been something I've been meaning to tell you 
label2 Just for the record  I did not want to be a part of this 
label2 Gee  I don't know if it's in the cards  sir 
label2 I'll give it a shot 
label2 Excuse me ?
label2 Oh  the reverse psychology thing  I see  That's very clever 
label2 Yeah  well  not necessary  We broke up again 
label2 Oh  how'd it go last night ?
label2 Really ? You waited months for time with that telescope  What happened ?
label2 You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night ?
label2 We get it  73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers 
label2 Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight ?
label2 No  What happened ?
label2 12 years after high school  and I'm still at the nerd table 
label2 Really ? This is going to decide who's the hero and who's the sidekick ?
label2 Every idea is better than this idea 
label2 Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night  None come to mind 
label2 Fellas  It's been 30 minutes  Nobody's touched each other 
label2 Lesser Warlord of Ka'a 
label2 Infinite Sheldon ?
label2 Do you understand why people don't want to play with you ?
label2 Oh  thanks 
label2 That's an atom 
label2 So  you and Zack again  huh ?
label2 They might be smarter than some people 
label2 You think Penny's right ? Were we bullying Zack ?
label2 That happened to you ?
label2 I don't know  I think we might owe the guy an apology 
label2 Why me ?
label2 What would I even say ?
label2 I got a better idea  We're all responsible  I say we all go  Come on  who's with me ? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me  I might get punched  You really want to miss that ?
label2 Yeah  we came to talk to Zack  Hey  Zack 
label2 Listen  uh  the stuff we were saying before  we were just kidding around 
label2 Come on  that's what we do  We give each other a hard time  Hey  Sheldon  you look like a praying mantis 
label2 Uh  we're on our way to the comic book store 
label2 Uh  no  Oh  this is Zack  He's a friend of ours  Zack  this is Stuart  He owns the store 
label2 Hey  I got new boots this year  Guaranteed to add three inches 
label2 You can't replace me with Zack 
label2 Fine  if Zack's going to be Superman  I want to be Green Lantern 
label2 You can be Aquaman 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 You're jogging 
label2 If it makes you feel any better  when I was dating Penny  she used to flip out on me all the time 
label2 She didn't tell you ?
label2 Okay  let me see if I understand this  You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize ?
label2 It's Leonard 
label2 Okay  listen  You don't have to wear the wig  At this party  we're gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl 
label2 Then what are you ?
label2 Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve 
label2 What about me ?
label2 Um  I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there 
label2 You're being a bully 
label2 What should we do ?
label2 Look  I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees  but I'm a little warm  so I'm going to turn it down 
label2 I had a great idea  You know how we're always having to stop and solve differential equations  like when you're doing Fourier analysis  or using the Schrodinger equation ?
label2 I was thinking  we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition  and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine  You just use your smartphone  take a picture of the equation and bam !
label2 Oh  yay for me  What about you guys ? I can't promise anything  but people do make money off stuff like this 
label2 I checked the App Store  No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving 
label2 She's not going to steal our idea 
label2 We're gonna write an application '
label2 It's not boring at all  You see  in higher order mathematics  there are certain sets of equations that '
label2 Satisfied ?
label2 That is ridiculous 
label2 Okay  we need to stop for a minute 
label2 Well  yes  and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer  Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer 
label2 Okay  You need to get clear on this right now  I am in charge of this project 
label2 Thank you  I thought we might start by talking about the user interface 
label2 So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation  but over here  you can press this  and just substitute new values for the coefficients 
label2 It's not a joke  It's the real design 
label2 Are you done ?
label2 We're not doing names now  Howard ?
label2 That's just Sheldon backwards 
label2 We're not wasting time with names right now 
label2 Oh Sheldon  stop it 
label2 That's enough  Sheldon 
label2 Because you're impossible to work with 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 But I fired you 
label2 Look  I'm still happy to drive you to work  Nothing's changed in that regard  We're still roommates  we're still friends 
label2 You know what ? Go put on your bus pants 
label2 Hold on  That's it !
label2 We're actually scanning equations and getting good results 
label2 Howard  did you solve the install time problem yet ?
label2 What are you doing ? !
label2 No  I mean  what are you doing with a theremin ?
label2 Sheldon ! We're working here !
label2 No  that was completely called for  We need quiet 
label2 Well  seeing as your project is to sabotage my project  yes 
label2 What's he doing in your apartment ?
label2 Why do you regret  uh  never mind  stupid question 
label2 We're not playing  This is real work 
label2 Then I guess we would let him back on the app team  and while we're doing that  you could take an aerial tour of L  A  on your flying pig 
label2 Okay  now that you're back on the team  let's get you caught up 
label2 Thank you  So as you can see  not only can you store your favourite equations  but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app 
label2 Thanks 
label2 I think her weekend just opened up 
label2 Don't worry  Just sit next to me during the quiz  and you can copy my answers 
label2 They're bigger than mine 
label2 Although yours was an eye-opener 
label2 Are you an element in the actinoid series ?
label2 Shh-shh-shh-shh  Sheldon's asleep  What's going on ?
label2 Uh  sure 
label2 So  how do you wanna do this ?
label2 Yeah  it is a little like getting into Dracula's coffin 
label2 Right  So we'll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone 
label2 Star Trek  You know  the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire 
label2 Of course  sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce 
label2 Got it  got it  We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up  you know ?
label2 Good night 
label2 Sure  no problem 
label2 True dat 
label2 I've gotten a lot more street since we broke up 
label2 No  No  I understand  I got too intense  you had to back off 
label2 I've gotten a lot better at that  you know  I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies 
label2 Okay  good night 
label2 Penny's here 
label2 I'd like to kick your little brown ass 
label2 No  Why do you ask ?
label2 I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture  Dr  Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable  Plus  he looks like a giant insect 
label2 Oh  Sheldon changed the password  It's now Penny is a freeloader  No spaces 
label2 Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight  We're reading the reviews 
label2 Read this woman's tweet 
label2 In a word  triumphant 
label2 I don't know  I kind of promised Howard 
label2 Oh  uh  from the context  we think it means kill me now 
label2 Yeah  it's weird  Even though he didn't want to give the lecture in the first place  being rejected by those students really hit him hard 
label2 I'm still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now  S-Y-F-Y  That's siffy 
label2 Hang on  Hang on  Uh-huh  Okay  thank you  Howard was on his scooter  and got hit by a truck  He's in critical condition 
label2 Have you seen him ?
label2 It'll be okay  It'll be okay 
label2 S-Y-F-Y  Sy-fee 
label2 I guess it depends on the zombies  Raj  Are we talking slow zombies  fast zombies ? Like  in 28 Days  if those zombies didn't eat  they starved 
label2 Are you sure this is right ?
label2 Oh  We should get going 
label2 Thanks 
label2 More than this ?
label2 He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God 
label2 Uh  b  d  uh  uh 
label2 Coffee maker ?
label2 On the bright side  I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers 
label2 Face it  Raj  we crashed and burned tonight 
label2 Mrs  Latham  the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser  ' cause it needs to warm up 
label2 You're kidding  That was good for you ? ' Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt 
label2 Well  wherever we're going  she's sending a car to pick me up 
label2 Excuse me  but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment  I've been published in peer-reviewed journals  I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics 
label2 That was a great meal 
label2 The only time I eat this well is when my mom's in town and she takes me out to dinner 
label2 You kind of remind me of her  She enjoys making people uncomfortable  too 
label2 Oh  good  good 
label2 Terrific  Great  What level is that ?
label2 Swell  I need a drink  Do we have any alcohol ?
label2 Well  Mrs  Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump 
label2 Then she stuck her tongue down my throat 
label2 She hit on me 
label2 I was able to get out of there before anything else happened  but she wants to see me again tomorrow night 
label2 Well  forget it ! It's not gonna happen 
label2 I repeat  not gonna happen 
label2 What's this ?
label2 I am not going to have sex with her 
label2 Good night  Sheldon 
label2 Hey  Hi 
label2 I'm very hungry  For food  right ?
label2 No  that's okay 
label2 Really ?
label2 Oh  Then what was last night about ?
label2 Thank you 
label2 Oh  don't say that  You're a very attractive woman 
label2 No  it's true 
label2 I'm sure I would  But why  why  exactly ?
label2 I hadn't really given it much thought 
label2 Do you mean ?
label2 No  I didn't do it for the money 
label2 No  I mean  I  I  I got the money first 
label2 Uh  I'm gonna go lie down 
label2 Hey  what's up ?
label2 Uh  sure  Why ?
label2 Still arguing over which CSI is the best ?
label2 Howard's gonna sleep here tonight  He had a fight with his mother 
label2 Wait  wait  What ?
label2 Priya's in town ?
label2 Hold on  When did Priya get here ?
label2 It's Leonard 
label2 I just want to talk to her 
label2 What are you doing here ?
label2 Why didn't you call ?
label2 I know  Last time I came on too strong  Can we talk in private ?
label2 The word is forbade 
label2 Penny  this is Raj's sister  Priya 
label2 Really ?
label2 I thought maybe after we eat  we could see an early movie 
label2 I love the way you say  I'd love that 
label2 My sister's 38 and married 
label2 Oh  come on  It's not boring at all  She's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology  Hmm ?
label2 Oh  wow  I love Taming of the Shrew  I did a paper on it in high school  Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ? In his tail 
label2 Whose tongue ?
label2 What  with my tongue in your tail ?
label2 Okay  I'm out of here 
label2 I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's  I think Howard's going to be there  You want to join us ?
label2 Can't we make a one-time exception for tonight ?
label2 Just come with me to Raj's 
label2 It's not a party  It's the same group of people who hang out here  hanging out over there 
label2 How come it's not a party when we do it here ?
label2 I guess you're right  See you later 
label2 Come with me to Raj's and eat there 
label2 I really doubt that's what he'll serve 
label2 What do you want to do ? You want to come with me  or do you want to sit here alone ?
label2 Just sit here 
label2 You do realize everyone's eating at Raj's again tonight ?
label2 You're having people over ?
label2 Of course  Good night 
label2 It certainly is 
label2 I am leaving 
label2 Of course I'll be back  I live here !
label2 This is delicious  Where'd you learn to make chili ?
label2 Did you know that  per our roommate agreement  I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower ? And not in the sink  We each have special buckets 
label2 Bam  Right in the nose  Made me proud to own a PC 
label2 Hear  hear 
label2 Oh  the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls 
label2 He kind of does 
label2 Aw  hell  I miss him 
label2 He actually got pretty good  He made us all matching serapes 
label2 Long before the cats  I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation  I still have some of the currency 
label2 Hey  I thought you were with your new buddies 
label2 Morning 
label2 Mm-hmm  Great  Hey  can I ask you something ?
label2 Last night  me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra  was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive ?
label2 Hey  if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys  I'd be okay with that 
label2 I tried in the seventh grade  I could never get used to them 
label2 Yeah  if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case 
label2 Th-th-th-that's okay  I can infer from context 
label2 Sorry ! Oop !
label2 Sorry ! Pardon me ! Oh  I'm so sorry ! My fault ! Check it out  I just got contacts 
label2 Hey  guys  what do you think ? Priya took me clothes shopping 
label2 Yeah  good  New contacts  I should have done this years ago 
label2 Just two  Everyday and dress 
label2 Oh  my god  you're breaking up with me ! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me ? That is so cruel 
label2 Oh  okay  So  what's up ?
label2 I know  I usually never see my ex-girlfriends  unless their hard drives crash 
label2 Oh  Okay 
label2 Sure  Oh  god  you smell so good  Of course  that could just be my other senses getting stronger  Hypothetically  if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform  would you wear it ?
label2 I'm sorry  I'm  never mind 
label2 Oh  hi 
label2 One of them's upstairs  The other one sort of slipped back into my skull 
label2 Yeah  bitches are the worst 
label2 Uh  Penny  there's something I have to tell you 
label2 All right  well  anyway  Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source  eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else 
label2 So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives ?
label2 Sure  that has birds in it 
label2 I'm sorry  but I'm gonna count that 
label2 Yeah  The doctor didn't want me to rub my eye during the night  It was either this or one of those giant neck cones 
label2 Oh  yes  Indeed  I did 
label2 She completely understood everything I said  Case closed 
label2 Maybe  but that's not my problem  She's not my girlfriend  you are 
label2 Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die  or is that just nature's way ?
label2 I am not opening that door  Sheldon 
label2 Whatcha doin ' ?
label2 Okay  I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here 
label2 Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant ?
label2 Or as you probably call it back home  food 
label2 No  no  I do  It's just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time 
label2 Does that mean you'd relocate here permanently ?
label2 Small world 
label2 Of course  I did  I talked and talked and talked 
label2 It is pretty spicy 
label2 Oh  okay  it's not important  It can wait 
label2 Uh  I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with 
label2 Well  uh  not far  Hey  if you ever wanna start a family  La Ca'ada has some great schools 
label2 Yes  There  I said it 
label2 And she likes you 
label2 Not really  no 
label2 Well  now  hold on  What kind of distance are we talking about ? Because we are neighbours  I mean  I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment 
label2 I don't listen for it  but it's nice to know everything's okay with your plumbing  The building's plumbing 
label2 No  I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low 
label2 Penny  wait 
label2 Oh  my God  what did they get ?
label2 You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account ?
label2 Oh  no  not Glenn ?
label2 Not the kind with access to drugs 
label2 Thank you  officer 
label2 I'm really sorry  Sheldon 
label2 I don't know 
label2 I'm on it 
label2 Hey  Penny  We're kind of in the middle of a crisis  here 
label2 Okay  what exactly are we looking for ?
label2 Uh  we are  In the meantime  you're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us 
label2 We got him  We're almost done 
label2 Why don't we play this smart ? Try a little good goblin  bad goblin 
label2 That's not where it was going 
label2 Oh  wait  Hang on  Are you upset ?
label2 Did your sister say anything when you got home last night ?
label2 I'll bet he's some loser who lives with his parents 
label2 Hold on  you're thinking of going there ?
label2 Fine  You walk up to the house  knock on the door and demand your stuff back  What if he says no ?
label2 No one's getting tortured 
label2 Oh  geez  I don't know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row 
label2 Aw  screw it  I'm in 
label2 Hit the ' Hey  sweetie  Yeah  I'm sorry  I'm gonna be working late  I  I  I miss you  too  Okay  sure  I'll call you when I get home  Okay  bye-bye 
label2 Cover for me 
label2 I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy 
label2 Totally 
label2 Okay  let's get clear on something  We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way  No one's bat'lething anybody 
label2 Come on 
label2 You're welcome to try  but the other day  it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box 
label2 Uh  Sheldon ?
label2 Something's wrong  I'm not getting any gas  Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines ?
label2 Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine ?
label2 Well  we'd better call somebody to come pick us up 
label2 Uh  I kind of told her I was working 
label2 Yeah  she doesn't really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Nice shot 
label2 Perfect 
label2 Shooting at a target ?
label2 An arrow 
label2 I'm not going to do that  Sheldon 
label2 Really ? How could you tell ?
label2 You don't say ?
label2 So  what's the gossip ?
label2 Oh  That's too bad  I wonder what happened 
label2 Boy  you sure get your money's worth out of these games 
label2 Oh  God 
label2 It's okay  You didn't know  I'll take care of it 
label2 Sheldon doesn't allow flossing that close to the mirror 
label2 It's a splatter thing  There's a little piece of tape on the floor you're supposed to stand behind 
label2 I know  Just do it  There's a big inspection coming up  and I don't want to lose my TV privileges 
label2 Mm  I don't know  I get a lawyer  he gets a lawyer  it's just easier to stand behind the tape 
label2 Yeah ! Dodgers are baseball  right ?
label2 Mm  it's complicated  but as I remember it  the essentials are  get chosen last  get hit by the ball  cry  go home 
label2 Well  it might not be a great idea to invite those two 
label2 Don't tell anybody I told you  but I heard she might be breaking up with him 
label2 Really ? Who ?
label2 What ? You're kidding !
label2 Wow  that's hard to believe 
label2 Oh  that one doesn't apply to you  You sit 
label2 I heard about it from Sheldon  He got it from Amy 
label2 Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom ?
label2 I didn't say Raj  Who said Raj ?
label2 I can't say 
label2 Well  The point is  if this got out  it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship 
label2 Oh  yeah ? What about it ?
label2 Whatever it is  we're here for you  You can tell us anything 
label2 Man  he's going to be blindsided 
label2 Hope you're hungry 
label2 Will Amy be joining us for dinner ?
label2 Good  good  Everything okay between you two ?
label2 No reason  I was just talking to Raj  and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days 
label2 Pass the soy sauce 
label2 Oh  hold on  Howard  There's lots of better times 
label2 Congratulations !
label2 That's great 
label2 You're pregnant ?
label2 I can't hear you  I'm in the shower 
label2 What kind of emergency ?
label2 You might not want to do that 
label2 Sheldon  I'm not alone in here 
label2 We were in here first  you can't be in here 
label2 Yeah  fine 
label2 Oh  Cool  I've got a lawyer  And I've seen her naked 
label2 Top of her class  Cambridge University  Licensed to practice law in three countries  And your face 
label2 Schooled !
label2 Superceded !
label2 I'd like to refer that to my attorney 
label2 Not as much as you 
label2 Uh  Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in ?
label2 What are you gonna do  Sheldon  blow up the apartment ?
label2 What's the big deal ?
label2 They're gonna find out about me eventually  right ?
label2 Are you ashamed of me ?
label2 Then why can't we tell your parents ?
label2 It's blackmail !
label2 Really ?
label2 Okay  see you later 
label2 That is good news  Bye 
label2 Okay  now I have to ask  What do they do ?
label2 All right 
label2 Okay  well  I look forward to playing with you 
label2 And what ?
label2 Excuse me  but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life 
label2 Got it  Bye 
label2 You okay ?
label2 Very pretty 
label2 Hadn't really thought about it 
label2 Uh  sure  Very ' prominent 
label2 Yeah  How did you know ?
label2 Hi  Hey  Raj  will you be joining us for dinner ?
label2 Really ? In front of your sister ?
label2 Wonder why she didn't tell me 
label2 Well  it's not as much surprised as  uh  uh  you know  uh  th-th-th-the other thing 
label2 Well  you know  if you  if  if  if you  uh  I don't  oh  what's the word I'm looking for ?
label2 Thank you  Befuddled  The word I was looking for was befuddled 
label2 I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part  Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to  ' cause I don't 
label2 I thought the movie was about 18th - century Vienna ?
label2 Thanks  yeah 
label2 Gals ? Who are you  Fred Flintstone ?
label2 I think the word you're looking for is befuddled 
label2 Hang on  When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart ?
label2 Oh  oh  Beekeeper to King 12  I capture your Pope and release the swarm  Checkmate on Sheldon 
label2 Uh  that's my water 
label2 My water  You're drinking it 
label2 Yes  It's my water 
label2 Here we go 
label2 What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married ?
label2 You all right ?
label2 Water nymph 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 Have you met Bernadette's parents ?
label2 That's not your water 
label2 Howard and his mother are at the hospital  Come on  we gotta go 
label2 I don't know  I just got a text  Come on  hurry 
label2 Sheldon  let's go !
label2 Right  fine  I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his 
label2 So  how is she ?
label2 Go sit over there 
label2 I'm fine  That's nice that they're getting along 
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 I don't care  I don't have anything to hide 
label2 No  I do not  You are a mean little man 
label2 There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly  but '
label2 Every once in a while  before we'd go to bed  I'd put on a little show for her 
label2 Well  you know  the way I took my clothes off 
label2 I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music 
label2 I wasn't swinging around a pole 
label2 No  she wouldn't 
label2 Hey  what took you guys so long ?
label2 That's nice  What about ?
label2 That's funny 
label2 It doesn't matter  I'm the king of foreplay 
label2 Hell Hounds 
label2 Oh  no  no  no  he doesn't 
label2 Well  you have milk in the taters  milk in the gravy  parmesan crust  Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy's Day balloon 
label2 So  no  on the Shepherd's Pie  Can we move on ?
label2 Kill me 
label2 So  what's your news  Bernadette ?
label2 So  Howard  tell us  how's it feel knowing that when you two get married  you'll be referred to as Mr  and Dr  Wolowitz ?
label2 Bernadette  that's great  Howard  do you make a buttload ?
label2 Hey  if I roll down the windows in the car  everything's peachy  If you do it  you're still not a doctor 
label2 What are you doing here ?
label2 In my bed ?
label2 Oh  you heard ?
label2 Sorry  Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here ?
label2 Oh  yeah  Mouth-to-Mouth Mona  You know  she used to date Howard ?
label2 We tried  She doesn't get along with Sheldon 
label2 Okay  well  how about this  Until Priya gets her own place  you stay here and I'll stay at your apartment 
label2 You ? Sure  Bring as many as you want 
label2 Do you really think you should be eating that cake ?
label2 If you're gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife  you might want to watch your waistline 
label2 Until you have kids 
label2 There's a reciprocity clause  You get to pull the plug on him  too 
label2 No backsies 
label2 Mmm  Mmm 
label2 Oh  come on ! Why don't we just tell them that we're dating ?
label2 When is the time ?
label2 You're moving back to India ?
label2 She's lying because she doesn't want you to know we're dating 
label2 Well  what difference does it make ? If you're moving back to India  we're obviously breaking up 
label2 Uh  That is a beautiful tapestry 
label2 I live here 
label2 Priya's going back to India 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 What are you grinding about ?
label2 Just let it go  Sheldon 
label2 She lied 
label2 What the hell is wrong with you ?
label2 Please  Sheldon would have been before you  and he might not even have genitals 
label2 Raj  come on  You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you  A month ago  you were writing poems about his fiancee 
label2 Oh  Bernadette  please play my clarinet 
label2 Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball ?
label2 I'm not in the mood  Sheldon 
label2 I don't want to talk to Amy 
label2 You called my mother ?
label2 What's going on ? What do you want ?
label2 That's so nice 
label2 Well  uh  okay  um  I don't want to get back together with Penny  We tried it  it was crazy  it didn't work  but I can't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj  And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya  who I've been going out with for eight months  is moving back to India  So I'm just completely confused and alone 
label2 Got any advice ?
label2 Excuse me  You're a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development  and all you've got is buck up ?
label2 Thanks  Mother  I feel much better 
label2 Hang on  Sheldon  How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India ?
label2 You know what  guys  I'm not in the mood for paintball  What do you say we just bag it ?
label2 Sorry  Sheldon  it's just not a good time for playing games 
label2 Yes  no and no 
label2 I'd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory  Captain Sheldon Cooper 
label2 Oh  uh  Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype  and we are gonna have a dinner date 
label2 That doesn't sound like mocking 
label2 I don't know  Why ?
label2 Listen  I don't want to be rude  but Priya's gonna be calling any minute  so '
label2 Oh  good 
label2 A hobby ?
label2 You know  some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance  They'd say things like  love is stronger than the miles between you 
label2 You video-chat with Amy all the time  How is this different ?
label2 Of course I like Amy 
label2 Hey  honey 
label2 Oh  I miss you  too 
label2 That's three minutes  Should we see what we got ?
label2 Not easy  but we're making it work 
label2 There's no junk jiggling  We just talk 
label2 I can't do that 
label2 I did it last night  I'm not doing it again 
label2 I don't want to talk about it  You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair 
label2 Sheldon  you do this all the time  You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion 
label2 It's like living with a Chihuahua 
label2 So  here we are  Back in bed together 
label2 Okay  so I  I  I guess I'll just jump right in 
label2 Uh  you're a naughty girl  And  and  uh  I  I want to punish you with my love ?
label2 Not good ?
label2 Okay  Uh  uh  you're not naughty  Uh  you're  you're  you're dirty  You're  you're a  a dirty girl ?
label2 Why don't you just give me five minutes ? I'll Google how to do this  I'll call you right back 
label2 Okay  like usual  Good 
label2 All rightie  Shirt coming off  Ta-da ! Man nipples 
label2 Yes  ma'am 
label2 Taking shorts off  There we go  Naked  naked  naked !
label2 Oh  damn it !
label2 No  no ! No-no-no ! The screen froze  It's probably just buffering  just give it a second 
label2 So  how are your mom and dad ?
label2 Yeah  Sure  sure 
label2 No  you listen  You're my woman  and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before 
label2 That's right  say my name  and beg me for more  ' cause  I'm gonna give it to you 
label2 Who wants the last dumpling ?
label2 Aren't you going with Sheldon ?
label2 Oh  Well  I have some work to do  so '
label2 Okay  Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home ?
label2 All righty then  Guess I'll just get started 
label2 I thought you were reading 
label2 I  I'm fine 
label2 Well  you stay as long as you'd like 
label2 It was good  good  Just out of curiosity  what time do you usually go to bed ?
label2 Not really  Is that my yearbook ?
label2 Rough night  Casey Jones ?
label2 Ah  sure  That'd be nice 
label2 Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon ?
label2 Amy  this is for you 
label2 I'm sorry  The bride and groom seem happy 
label2 That sounds like a late night  and I have work in the morning  so '
label2 I'm not moody  I'm fun 
label2 Well  hey  I'm just as much fun as you are 
label2 I did have a great time  Thank you for reminding me it's okay to have fun once in a while 
label2 And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin 
label2 Well  okay  Again  thank you 
label2 Want to come in  have a cup of tea ?
label2 Okay  Well  good night 
label2 Sounds like you had a great night 
label2 Well  it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time  Although  truth be told  my groin's a little worse for wear 
label2 Hey  how go the wedding plans  Howard ?
label2 See  this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9000 miles away  I can spend my nights doing whatever I want 
label2 Maybe  We enter the dungeon 
label2 Are you gonna eat that whole pie ?
label2 Oh  God  did you watch Bridget Jones again ?
label2 Now that Howard's getting married  maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you 
label2 Are we ready to order ?
label2 Do you really want that ?
label2 You left out  got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants 
label2 Yeah  every night for the last month 
label2 You think she's taking advantage of him ?
label2 Deaf women can't be gold diggers ?
label2 Could you tell us ?
label2 Look  I know they have money  I don't think it's that much 
label2 Listen  guys  I'm sorry  I don't mean to be rude  but I need to go call Raj's sister  who I love so much  So vastly much 
label2 Yeah  real big of you 
label2 It's from Game of Thrones  What do you think ?
label2 What did you have in mind ?
label2 Well  they don't have an Excalibur here  so what do you want to do ?
label2 Yeah  It's okay  I guess 
label2 Hang on  Can you do any better ?
label2 Slow down  Two hundred 
label2 Will you shut up ?
label2 Nope  Maybe another time 
label2 Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet 
label2 Okay  fine  Just the sword  two ten 
label2 See that ? I just saved us forty bucks 
label2 No  it's okay  I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest 
label2 Thank you 
label2 I was actually thinking about going 
label2 Sheldon  can you grab me a water ?
label2 Can you or can't you ?
label2 It never is  is it ?
label2 Got it  Can I have my water ?
label2 I'd like to propose a toast  The dream to go up into space is one we all share  and Howard's making that a reality  We're all very proud of you 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Pretty cool about Howard  huh ?
label2 For God's sake  will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff 
label2 You never stop talking  do you ?
label2 Wait  let me see if I got this right  You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night ?
label2 I hate to say it  but she did kind of betray you 
label2 Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you 
label2 I'm going to a party  I'm not turning R2 - D2 and C - 3PO over to the empire !
label2 All right  Sheldon  we're going to Wil's  This is your last chance 
label2 You want to drive ?
label2 Hey  Sheldon ?
label2 Really ? Brent Spiner  Mr  Data himself  You love him 
label2 I'm going  Live long and prosper  Sheldon 
label2 What are you doing here ?
label2 Can we get autographed dolls ?
label2 Twelve 
label2 So what kind of cruise is this you're going on ?
label2 What's Gunning with God ? I'm afraid to ask 
label2 Sheldon  she just got off the plane  She doesn't want to cook 
label2 All right  that settles it  we're going out  Do you like sushi ? There's a great little place down the street 
label2 Sheldon  you're talking like a crazy person 
label2 What's the last thing you were ever happy about ?
label2 Uh  kung fu letters might not be politically correct 
label2 Yeah  yeah  that  too 
label2 Please pester her  Please  for me 
label2 So  Mrs  Cooper  what did you think of the sushi ?
label2 Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank 
label2 We don't say that  either  I'll make you a list 
label2 You want some Oreos ?
label2 No  regular 
label2 These are delicious 
label2 Everything ? Aren't you worried about your health ?
label2 I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there 
label2 Sorry  Syrup 
label2 I hadn't '
label2 Mrs  Cooper  we say Catholics  not rosary rattlers 
label2 What are you gonna do ? She wanted to see churches 
label2 Oh  I'm not sure we should 
label2 Hang on  Looks like everyone's a winner 
label2 Uh  yeah  It's issue number 21  First appearance of Hellboy 
label2 Yes  but you'd be using your superpowers for evil 
label2 Leonard 
label2 Thanks  You  too  You know  go ahead and take it 
label2 Uh  yeah  yeah  sure  I guess 
label2 No  I don't think I picked her up  Besides  I have a girlfriend 
label2 More Halloween candy ? Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday ?
label2 Will you relax ? I'll get it in a minute  Hey  how was work ?
label2 Excuse me 
label2 Check it out  Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con 
label2 Well  you know  it's Comic Con  I'm Lion-O from ThunderCats 
label2 No  But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly 
label2 Cool  Oh  look  That's you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume  Comic Con ?
label2 You're very talented  This is really good  Did you do '
label2 Hey  you got a minute ?
label2 Thanks 
label2 No  Sulfites  Migraines 
label2 Okay  we used to go out  right ?
label2 I'm dealing with a situation and it's kind of about my love life  so I know that might be weird for us to talk about  but in this area  as you know  all my other friends are just so stupid 
label2 So  you're okay talking about this ?
label2 You're sure it's not weird 
label2 You know what  if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy  then I would be fine with that 
label2 Okay  uh  here it is  Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend '
label2 Come on 
label2 I met this girl  and she's great  We have a lot in common 
label2 No  We just made out a little 
label2 Well  I was gonna  but there were too many tongues in my mouth 
label2 Here's the thing  I  I'm not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman 
label2 Oh  that's not who I am 
label2 Now  let's not do anything rash  She's really hot 
label2 Priya and I are in love  I think we could get married someday 
label2 Now we're getting somewhere 
label2 Go ask Penny ; she'll know what to do 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Hey  well  see you  I'm going out 
label2 Oh  what the hell  I'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store  Alice  but I don't know if I should  because I'm going out with Priya  but she's in India 
label2 Well  they say at the end of your life  you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did  and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do 
label2 That actually does help 
label2 Do you mind ? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now 
label2 Damn it  I can't  I can't  I can't do this 
label2 No  no  no  I  I can't do this  Believe me  I really want to 
label2 But I kind of have a girlfriend 
label2 You're cool with you and me just being friends  right ?
label2 Wait  I don't  which part ?
label2 Oh  no  no  you have it wrong  No  I  I was going to be a jackass  but I stopped myself  I stayed a good guy  so  I'm gonna pass on the sex  But you should know  that's not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness  That's kind of my superpower  I'm  like  Captain Good Guy 
label2 Hey  Priya 
label2 Uh  not so good  We have to talk 
label2 Okay  uh  here it is  I met this girl and I kissed her  and I feel terrible about it  But it's done  it's never gonna happen again  And I am so  so sorry 
label2 It is ?
label2 Uh  kind of ?
label2 No  no  I messed up a little  You messed up a lot 
label2 Fine  What would you like to talk about  Sheldon ?
label2 Hey  Amy  what brings you to our neck of the woods ?
label2 This time  it's your fault 
label2 Amy  how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me ?
label2 No  it's not gonna do it 
label2 Leonard's coming down the home stretch ! Come on  horsey  you can do this ! Damn  Come on  thigh muscles  you can do this ! Yes ! First place  I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall  And scared of horses  Sheldon  you're up 
label2 Come on  it's your turn  We said we'd get more fresh air 
label2 Did you try calling her on the telephone ?
label2 If you're worried  we can go over there and see if she's all right 
label2 I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat 
label2 You do ?
label2 Forget about the bobcat 
label2 Uh  she's your friend  Step up 
label2 I'm single  I don't need this crap 
label2 For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man ?
label2 Moo-shu is Penny 
label2 Oh  he was up late last night  so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed 
label2 Yeah  but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play 
label2 Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her 
label2 Hold on  did you talk about us when we were dating ?
label2 What's going on ?
label2 Really ? Amy ?
label2 Hi  Amy 
label2 Cuddles ?
label2 Amy  what are you doing here ?
label2 Yeah  but why didn't you go back to your apartment ?
label2 Maybe we should get you home 
label2 Yeah  Sheldon  what would it take ?
label2 Okay  Come on  Upsy-daisy 
label2 Not really 
label2 Not on Blu-ray  Only twice on Blu-ray 
label2 Really ? Do we do that ?
label2 You know  we haven't spent time alone together since we broke up 
label2 Sounds like most of my dates 
label2 Well  he's smart and crazy enough  he may have actually created a monster 
label2 What the hell is going on ?
label2 Sheldon  just ignore him 
label2 I don't know  Scree-scree 
label2 Sorry  Do you think I'm overdressed ?
label2 I'm going to the movies with Penny  I don't want her to think that I think it's a date 
label2 No  but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't 
label2 Are we overthinking this ?
label2 You're right  I'm fine  I'm wearing this 
label2 Oh  yeah  sure  There's also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America 
label2 Can't argue with that  I'll get the tickets 
label2 Actually  you know what ? I think it's about time I pick a movie we see 
label2 No  You always picked  and it was always the same  An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along 
label2 I hate those movies 
label2 Yes  I do  The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them  and I wanted to have sex  To this day  I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused 
label2 All the time 
label2 Does this sound familiar ? I'd love to go shoe shopping with you  Hiking ? It's great  It's two a  m   of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends  Who wouldn't ?
label2 Thanks  Tickets are eleven bucks  Not a date 
label2 Come on  you enjoyed the movie  I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded  and everyone had to relocate 
label2 Are you sure ? Because you always say no  and then you eat half my fries 
label2 No  I love them  I save them for the end  but they're gone because you ate them  And why did I let you eat them ?
label2 Exactly  But this is not a date  So I ask again  would you like anything ?
label2 Great  That'll be five dollars  I am having the best time  I'm so glad you suggested we do this 
label2 Uh  right 
label2 You're kidding me  Uh  can I see you for a sec over here ?
label2 I know what you're doing 
label2 You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date 
label2 I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses 
label2 I'm serious  I'll do it 
label2 They're in a group  I'm scared 
label2 Um  let's see  Hiking  Karaoke in Koreatown  Any Jennifer Aniston movie 
label2 No  it's fine  You can ditch away 
label2 It's cool  Go back to Kevin 
label2 Interesting  So now that he's gone  you want to hang out with me 
label2 Don't worry about it  You know  there's some guys over there  You should go talk to them 
label2 That's kind of between me and '
label2 Hey  pal  You didn't see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter 
label2 When you were telling Kevin about your acting career  did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory ?
label2 Oh  yeah ? Spell asthma 
label2 Maybe I'm not done hanging out with '
label2 Okay  So  we went out  saw a movie  met some nice people  said horrible things about each other in public  all in all  a pretty magical night 
label2 I know  I  I  I crossed a line  And I'm sorry  No  no  no  hang on  I really mean it  And it's not like when we were going out  I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed  This is a 100 % sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry 
label2 Just to be clear  sex is off the table  right ?
label2 Maybe we're not ready to hang out as friends 
label2 Well  then  I'm putting sex back on the table  What do you think about that ?
label2 You do ? Because if that's what you like  I can be that guy  I swear  I'll be anything you want me to be 
label2 I am such an asthmatic dumbass  I had a weird night 
label2 Well  ho-hold on  What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat ?
label2 Sure  I guess 
label2 I hate all of you and myself  Three 
label2 Hey  can I talk to you about something ? It's a little awkward 
label2 Yeah  that's not it  Stuart's kind of interested in Amy 
label2 You know what ? Never mind  I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out 
label2 I am not washed-up 
label2 A tribe of Abra-Comanches 
label2 We should go easy on him  Amy's out with Stuart tonight 
label2 Hocus Pocus Pocahontas 
label2 It's you 
label2 Oh come on  no ! We just bought the regular pack 
label2 With a hologram ? Nice  Hey  do you see this ?
label2 Sheldon  why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men ?
label2 That's all of us  Can I use the laptop ?
label2 I have to buy that stupid collector's tin 
label2 Yeah  it's ' Penny already eats our food  she can pay for Wi-Fi  ' No spaces 
label2 You want to hear something weird ?
label2 Yeah  because I have something weird to tell her 
label2 There's this guy  Jimmy Speckerman  who used to torment me in high school  He sent me a message through Facebook  He's in town and wants to have drinks 
label2 Just do it  ' cause he's not gonna let it go 
label2 I don't know 
label2 No  that was a different guy 
label2 No  that was a different  different guy 
label2 No  but  actually  that was this guy's sister 
label2 I don't know 
label2 I told you  That was a different guy 
label2 It's two a  m  What are you doing up ?
label2 Sure  You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year 
label2 Thanks 
label2 You know what ? I am tired of living in fear of this guy  I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school  You know  pick on someone your own size  you did not have sex with my mother  and yes  I do know why I'm hitting myself  '
label2 You bet  I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school 
label2 Scrotum 
label2 Uh  stapled 
label2 Oh  hi 
label2 Yeah  You  too  Uh  Jimmy  this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard 
label2 The Newcomb medal 
label2 Oh  I can't take all the credit  You helped a lot 
label2 Jimmy  I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me 
label2 What's the idea ?
label2 I don't think something like that's even possible 
label2 Sheldon  I got this 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit 
label2 14 is not  oh  yeah  never mind 
label2 Nancy  You called me Nancy for three years 
label2 Come on  guys 
label2 Hey  for the record  Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed  That one has my mother written all over it 
label2 Here's your cocoa 
label2 You got one for good luck 
label2 Laxative 
label2 Really ?
label2 Uh  yeah  Sure  I guess 
label2 Well  yeah  thanks  Jimmy 
label2 Are you okay to drive ?
label2 No  no  no  come on in  I'll make you a cup of coffee 
label2 You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard 
label2 Yeah  just back there 
label2 Yeah  It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people 
label2 What was I supposed to do ? He needed a place to sleep it off 
label2 Morning  Jimmy 
label2 Yeah  you did  So  uh  listen  it was great to see you again  And  and  and thanks for the apology 
label2 That's my French toast 
label2 Okay  Jimmy  it's time for you to go 
label2 No  you're done  I want you out of my apartment right now 
label2 I'm not afraid of you any more  Jimmy  Now get out !
label2 Sheldon  he's just practising for his cousin's birthday party 
label2 Sheldon  he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids  I really don't think they're gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie 
label2 Next time  you should open with that 
label2 Oh  a little Red Dead Redemption  huh ?
label2 Some people go outside and do that 
label2 You know digital alcohol is never a solution  What's going on ?
label2 Glad I was sitting down for that  Did you and Amy get in a fight ?
label2 No  I can't  I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later  Look  I'm no expert in women 
label2 That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you 
label2 I don't know what to tell you  Buy her something 
label2 Well  you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture 
label2 Glad I could help 
label2 There you go  Howard  Sounds like Raj'll have your babies  problem solved 
label2 What are you gonna do ?
label2 You know  there's no guarantee even if you have kids that you're going to like them 
label2 It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book 
label2 Look  Howard  I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea  but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years  Do not throw her back 
label2 You feel like trying something new for dinner ? Maybe Indian  Tex-Mex ?
label2 Okay  let's talk about that 
label2 We all do  Now  how about dinner ?
label2 Excuse me  Amy  Penny  do you have plans for dinner tonight ?
label2 No  I mean just you and me 
label2 Not like a date  a date 
label2 Okay  how do I look ?
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 I didn't defile your sister  we had a relationship 
label2 Oh  boy  do I ?
label2 Where on earth did you get that from ?
label2 That doesn't make it true 
label2 See you later 
label2 So  do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with ?
label2 Hey  how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date ? See how that goes 
label2 So  Polly  tell me about yourself 
label2 Oh  sorry  yeah  Awkward 
label2 Oh  God  no  The money's pretty good  And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal 
label2 Not some kind of nerd  I am the king of the nerds 
label2 Uh  it means if anyone displeases me  I don't help them set up their printer 
label2 Good  Remember that when I take my shirt off 
label2 I'm sorry  what did I say ?
label2 Oh  God 
label2 You said always  You'll always have feelings for me 
label2 So  that sounds more like something you'd say if you didn't want a relationship with someone  This isn't working out  but I'll always have feelings for you  I'm sorry I slept with your best friend  but I'll always have feelings for you  Here's the thing  Lisa  I'm into dudes now  but I'll always have feelings for you 
label2 I have feelings for you 
label2 No  I'm not 
label2 What does she want from me now ?
label2 I don't understand 
label2 Okay  but earlier it seemed like '
label2 Yeah  except for when I got the foot cramp 
label2 Well  there was a lot at stake 
label2 Well  I want to go get my asthma inhaler  but it might ruin the moment  Just  just help me out here  How does a miserable date end in sex ?
label2 Well  I'm a pretty smart guy  and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply  so give it a go 
label2 Why ? What are you afraid of ?
label2 What if I dump you ?
label2 Exactly  We pretend like our date went badly 
label2 And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything's cool 
label2 Yeah  hi  hi  How's it going ?
label2 Well  uh  uh  what are you doing up ?
label2 Yeah  well  so was I 
label2 The  the gas station across the street 
label2 Uh  uh  uh  yes  I did 
label2 I don't want beef jerky 
label2 We are next to a Suburu with a Gore / Lieberman bumper sticker 
label2 Well  hey  we're grown-ups  We can still be friends 
label2 Yeah  it's all good  We-We'll always have feelings for each other 
label2 See  she knew what always meant 
label2 I'm just making a point 
label2 Oh  that is not true 
label2 Unbelievable 
label2 Well  I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other  That was the plan  right ?
label2 You know what ? I don't have to stand here and take this crap 
label2 Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now ?
label2 What are we doing ?
label2 Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly 
label2 What ? Yeah 
label2 I don't know  he was pretty badass on Heroes 
label2 No  I mean just you and me 
label2 Yes  and I think we should go anyway 
label2 Excuse me  sorry  excuse me 
label2 Sorry  I'm having dinner with Penny  I have to get out of here 
label2 Me  too  I missed you 
label2 Oh  I can take it slow  Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school  Karen Berberick ? To this day she doesn't know we were going out  Made it easier on her when I broke things off 
label2 How about this  are you familiar with the typical development for computer software ?
label2 Before an application is released  they give it a trial run  W-We could do that  And if we hit a rough spot  instead of getting mad  just say  hey  we found a bug  and we report it so it can be fixed 
label2 Well  technically  this would be an alpha test  A beta test requires people that weren't involved in the development of the appli '
label2 Great  You keep a list  I'll keep a list  At some point  we'll exchange 
label2 Night  Attaboy  Hofstadter  Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies  Hey  I'm back 
label2 Um  I'm not sure  but I think the right answer here is no 
label2 Even Doctor Who ?
label2 My bug report to you 
label2 It's colour coded 
label2 Uh  red means fix right away  Yellow is eh  whenever you get a chance  And green is I could probably learn to live with it  There's a key down here at the bottom  It's neat  huh ?
label2 So  have a good night 
label2 Look at that  Some day  we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard 
label2 Can you finish it later ?
label2 Great  Good  Great  What are you reading ?
label2 They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that  don't they ? All right  Look  just remember how this works  We don't get mad about these things  Uh  speaking of which  I've addressed your bug report on my date planning  Got a really fun evening for you  It's kind of a surprise 
label2 Thank you 
label2 All right  fair enough  I certainly can be quieter when we kiss  I thought it was an expression of passion  but if it's coming across as juicy and weird  who wants that ? Uh  uh  I'm sorry  can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid ? Nah  never mind  it's right here 
label2 I called your dad  I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid  This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it 
label2 You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest ?
label2 Right  Sorry  sorry 
label2 Right  Sorry 
label2 I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto  I think I know how to handle a gat 
label2 So  I've got a gunshot wound  That's pretty badass 
label2 Hello ? They gave me a Band-Aid  Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary  That is the law 
label2 Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room  Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand ?
label2 So  are we still taking things slow ? Because a gunshot wound today  last week  I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer  We don't know how much time I have 
label2 Aaargh  What the hell ?
label2 Oh  no  come on !
label2 I have to get a lock for my door 
label2 Sheldon  Canada is not going to invade California 
label2 Oh  fun  I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People 
label2 I don't know  what am I doing ?
label2 Because the cafeteria doesn't offer little packets of methamphetamine 
label2 You know what  I'm so tired I can't even think straight  I'm going home  Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later ?
label2 Oh  can't you take the bus to the dentist ?
label2 I don't care  I'm done 
label2 Where do I sign ?
label2 There  Done 
label2 I'm gonna go home and take a nap 
label2 ' Sup ?
label2 Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo  hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan 
label2 Hey  did you ever make it to the dentist ?
label2 Absolutely  If you admit that you're a 30 - year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own 
label2 Why is that good ?
label2 What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor ?
label2 To wine and bubble wrap  And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water 
label2 I thought because our relationship's in a beta test  you wanted to take things slow 
label2 I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth 
label2 Since when don't you knock ? It's like the only good thing about you 
label2 Fine  what is it ?
label2 S'mores  huh ? Good for you 
label2 No  thanks  I'm good 
label2 No  don't aw him  He brought this all on himself 
label2 No  he's crazy  Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it'll suck you back in 
label2 I thought you said candles were dangerous 
label2 That we go back to the way things were  But when I do something for you  you show a little appreciation 
label2 You say thank you 
label2 I kind of like the sound of that 
label2 So  do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day ?
label2 Can I control the thermostat ?
label2 Really  Who do you think did that  Sheldon ?
label2 Positive 
label2 It's not funny  That mistake got published 
label2 Doesn't look happy  so I'm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon 
label2 Told ya 
label2 What the hell are you doing ?
label2 What are you doing hiding back there ?
label2 Lobster traps ?
label2 What are you going to do when you get to the university ? People are going to recognize you 
label2 Sheldon  there are a million great vacations you could take  What about Hawaii ?
label2 Sheldon  everybody takes vacations 
label2 It doesn't matter what I say  you're gonna tell me anyway 
label2 Wow  That's rough 
label2 Absolutely not  If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling  then Leonard gots to get paid  So  you think about us getting married ?
label2 Joke all you want  but you think about it 
label2 Good luck catching a man with that attitude 
label2 Where's Howard ?
label2 Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup 
label2 Hey  Howard  I need to tell you something 
label2 Uh  listen  I heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a pre-nup 
label2 What are you gonna do ?
label2 What choice did the university have ? He snapped  It happens to theoretical physicists all the time 
label2 Can't be very long 
label2 What's he doing here ?
label2 H-h-h-hang on  Howard  Barry  how good of a shot are you ?
label2 It's gonna be hard to find something you're both equally good at 
label2 All right  this is one-on-one  First person to five wins the office  Any questions ? Yes  Sheldon ?
label2 Balls in the basket 
label2 You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us ?
label2 I get it 
label2 No  he didn't  Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose  Okay  uh  forget one-on-one  Let's try a free throw contest  First person who makes a basket wins the office 
label2 No  No  I'm not 
label2 All right  we gave it 45 minutes  It's no longer funny  Let's try something else 
label2 Uh  on the count of three  both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can  The highest bounce wins the office 
label2 All right  that's enough trash talk  One  two  three 
label2 Congratulations  Sheldon  You win office 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Why is there a hole here ?
label2 If you're not happy  why don't you just let Kripke have the office ?
label2 What happened ?
label2 Why would you do that ?
label2 Hang in there  I'll be right back 
label2 I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things  I'll pick you up when you're done 
label2 Excuse us for a second  Sheldon  it's okay  he can do it  He's a barber 
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 There's no such thing as haircut records 
label2 Have you ever seen them ?
label2 Sheldon  you're a grown man  he's a professional  and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946  Just sit down and let him do it 
label2 When you tell this story later  the word we usually use is quirky 
label2 Sure  What are you doing ?
label2 Sheldon  be nice 
label2 You know  I think this is a good stopping point  Uh  it's your first real game  I threw a lot of information at you 
label2 Like I said  complicated game 
label2 Did you have fun ? Because if you had fun  then you are  you are a winner  Now that's  that-that's what chess is all about 
label2 I don't know  Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot  I'm guessing someone went back in time  stepped on a bug  and changed the course of human events 
label2 I got to tell you  I'm a little worried about him 
label2 Sheldon  it's three o'clock in the morning 
label2 I was sleeping 
label2 No  he doesn't 
label2 Oh  hi  Penny  guess what ? Sheldon got bongos 
label2 Richard Feynman was a famous physicist 
label2 Sheldon  go to bed  You have work in the morning 
label2 W-w-wuh  no  no  hang on  uh  uh  roommate agreement  No hootenannies  sing-a-longs  or barbershop quartets after ten p  m 
label2 Poor guy  He must have been exhausted  Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo !
label2 I'm sorry  duh  what ?
label2 What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked ?
label2 Oh  I don't know  I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer  be more physically active  Get some exercise 
label2 Good point  I'm in 
label2 It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us 
label2 All right  let's do it 
label2 Hey  Sheldon  clear your weekend  Starting Saturday morning  Star Wars < marathon
label2 We are going to play the online game 
label2 I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems 
label2 That's what your father used to say ?
label2 Hey  listen  I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend  but then I wondered  because we're in this relationship-beta-test  if I should have asked you first  Then I thought if I did check with you first  you'd think that I was taking things to seriously  And then  then I got a nosebleed 
label2 Ay papi ? What is that ?
label2 Keep an eye on those expiration dates  I've been burned more than once 
label2 You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there ? You might be short one 
label2 Well  we're always the good guys  In D & D  we're lawful good  in City Of Heroes  we're the heroes  in Grand Theft Auto  we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat 
label2 Uh  if it's yoghurt that helps ladies poop  I think Raj beat you to it 
label2 Uh  it is  but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny 
label2 Raj  Imperial Troopers on your tail 
label2 All right  I think we got them all  Let's divide up the loot 
label2 Mmm  you liked Professor Guyster's wedding 
label2 I'm sorry  you are our resident cut-up ?
label2 Prove it 
label2 Who's there ?
label2 Interrupting physi '
label2 You went to the comic-book store by yourself ?
label2 Awesome !
label2 They're Collectables 
label2 Once you open the box it loses its value 
label2 Really ? I don't even notice any more 
label2 Well I told you  you don't  it's mint in box 
label2 It's broken 
label2 Absolutely 
label2 Okay  that I believe 
label2 So  is that one mine 
label2 Well  hand it over so I can open it 
label2 And that's a lie  right ?
label2 You're kidding 
label2 That's amazing  You'll be like his pit crew  A word of caution  I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him 
label2 Yeah  he worships Hawking 
label2 Boy  a restraining order from Stephen Hawking  It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from Leonard Nimoy  Carl Sagan and Stan Lee 
label2 Like it was ten hours ago  What about it ?
label2 Still going to introduce him ?
label2 So  come on  how was the first day with Hawking ?
label2 Raj  you're our group historian  Has Sheldon ever begged before ?
label2 You do realize you own his ass right now 
label2 It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me  I'd take it and run 
label2 Give it a second 
label2 Also instead of just living in your mother's house  you could actually live inside her body 
label2 Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful 
label2 No  he didn't 
label2 Good for you  Howard  I'm proud of you  And still  you're the first one of us to get married  We have to do something special 
label2 Look at that  in 30 seconds  we went from hiring women to being them 
label2 Yeah  just going to a restaurant  get some steaks and scotch  Nothing to worry about 
label2 Well  I don't know  It's a bachelor party  There could be strippers  Wouldn't that make you a little jealous ?
label2 Hey  I am a young man in his sexual prime  Under the right conditions  I-I-I am capable of just  really crazy stuff 
label2 Oh  come on  that's got to count  There was a really strong undertow  we could have died 
label2 Oh  I will  There is no telling what might happen 
label2 You know  there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid get through their S  A  T  ' s 
label2 Hey  I got to hand it to Raj  he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party 
label2 Whoa  it's a little early to start dropping J-bombs  don't you think ?
label2 Oh  hey  Wil  Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard 
label2 Oh  yeah  no worries 
label2 Oh  all right 
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 Sheldon '
label2 So  Howard Wolowitz tying the knot  Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind  He was a wild one  Well  I guess we all kind of were  I remember this one time  I was with this girl at the beach  We were in the ocean and we started making out  I know  it was crazy  I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks  Then '
label2 Right  To Howard 
label2 I totally had sex in the ocean 
label2 Well  Howard  I don't know much about women 
label2 No  uh  that  that's it  I don't know much about women  Raj  you got anything ?
label2 Come on  please 
label2 Folding a sheet in my underwear  still pretty crazy 
label2 Do you think maybe it's tight because you're wearing long underwear ?
label2 No  it should be : why are you ?
label2 I'm sorry  Howard  but I got to tell you  I'm a little relieved you're not going 
label2 Come on  you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians 
label2 When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say  ooh  check out this Blu-ray player  it must be good  it was built in Russia ' ?
label2 You must be burning up 
label2 Check it out  It's the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages  But it also has an interesting secondary use  Here  Breathe this in 
label2 I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life 
label2 Mm-hmm 
label2 Oh  great 
label2 And I promise  after waiting four months  fast is what you're gonna get 
label2 So we won't let it get weird 
label2 I'm sorry  I did  I crossed a line  I didn't mean to !
label2 I don't know  it just came out  People say weird things during sex all the time 
label2 Again  I'm sorry  You know  with Howard and Bernadette getting married  I got caught up in a little wedding fever  I take it back 
label2 Okay  at some point  we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story  Why don't we just start doing that now ?
label2 No  Hey  do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed ? And you were all  like  what are you doing ? That was so funny  So funny 
label2 Give it a minute  Is that a little smile I see there ? I should go 
label2 Sheldon  knight takes bishop  You all right ?
label2 Are you ? You left your queen exposed from above  you trapped your knight in the corner  and you keep sighing and saying  why me ?
label2 We got you that book last year  Wasn't everything in there ?
label2 Well  if it makes you feel any better  I screwed things up pretty good with Penny 
label2 I guess we are  So  what's going on ?
label2 I'm sorry  that must be very difficult for you 
label2 Shame on her 
label2 She's good 
label2 You mean  like in bed or in the shower ?
label2 Well  if you had a physical relationship  I'd say propose during sex  Turns out that's a real mood killer 
label2 Pretty much 
label2 Hey  Off to work ?
label2 Have a nice night 
label2 I noticed you never answered me 
label2 Uh  follow-up  Are we still dating ?
label2 Is it still weird ' cause I proposed ?
label2 I have a couple more quick questions  Do you want to call me from the car ?
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Sheldon  what channel is NASA TV ?
label2 There's Howard's rocket  live from Kazakhstan 
label2 That's so great 
label2 Come on  Sheldon  it'll be fun 
label2 Where'd you get a beer ?
label2 I don't want to talk about it 
label2 She said no  can we drop it now ?
label2 What  I can't propose ? I can't talk to my friends ? Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do ?
label2 Will you shut up ?
label2 That's so cool 
label2 How about our roof ?
label2 I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man 
label2 Come on  Raj  we're ready to start 
label2 Hey  I didn't say it 
label2 No  come on in  Hurry 
label2 This is it 
label2 Mm-hmm  International Space Station  250 miles that way 
label2 Mm  conducting experiments in zero gravity 
label2 Interesting question  On the one hand  I always thought '
label2 I know what the anthropic principle is 
label2 Then I believe that God created the world in six days  and on the seventh he made you to annoy me 
label2 Well  hang on  Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't ?
label2 Actually  I'm hanging out with Penny 
label2 Sheldon  are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy ?
label2 No occasion  You know  things have been a little weird between us  so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you 
label2 I got all your favourites  Beer  wings  sliders  We can watch the football game  I even painted my stomach 
label2 Great  Just relax and enjoy  Tonight is all about you 
label2 So  where exactly are we in this relationship ?
label2 I just know the longer we wait to talk about it  the weirder it gets 
label2 Oh  I'll get it  Go sports 
label2 What are you doing here ? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy 
label2 I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this 
label2 I'm good 
label2 That's great  Get out 
label2 Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about 
label2 Some people might say it was romantic 
label2 Actually  to this day  she's never really said it 
label2 Go ahead 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Sheldon  you are not in charge 
label2 It'll be fine  Just  uh  pretend he's Wolowitz 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Maybe your tongue is shrinking 
label2 I'm starting to get a sense of it  Don't worry  I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow 
label2 I wish there were more 
label2 Where exactly did your mother have you tested ?
label2 Okay  I think I understand 
label2 The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you  but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires 
label2 I was  Now I'm having a nightmare  What do you want ?
label2 Gelatinous Sphere 
label2 Why would I be interested ? I have Penny 
label2 You can't just replace someone you care about with some other random person 
label2 Yes  you walked around for a week saying  Sheldon unhappy with casting choice 
label2 What's your point ?
label2 This is ridiculous  Are we gonna play cards or not ?
label2 So  I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning 
label2 I didn't have to take him for ice cream 
label2 Just say it 
label2 Mm-hmm 
label2 Mmm  doesn't matter  Half the time  he just ends up playing with the box 
label2 No  no  no  no 
label2 I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty 
label2 So  you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff ?
label2 Not gonna happen 
label2 If you want help  just hire a grad student 
label2 Smooth  Hi 
label2 Sheldon  aren't you going to introduce us ?
label2 Ah  congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul  I'm Leonard  This is Raj 
label2 She seems nice 
label2 All I said was she seems nice 
label2 Wait  Alex  Do you want to join us ?
label2 Given her what ?
label2 Oh  sure  Please join us 
label2 So  Alex  what's the topic of your dissertation ?
label2 Oh  that happens to be Dr  Koothrappali's field of expertise  You two have a lot to talk about 
label2 No  But compared to your boss  he's the poster boy for sanity 
label2 Oh  SETI  the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  You should introduce him to Sheldon  The search is over 
label2 High-energy lasers 
label2 Ah  it was all right  I guess  Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon  Caught Raj right in the eye 
label2 No  Raj had to go to the nurse 
label2 Mmm  the nurse is a woman  so he couldn't talk to her  She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt 
label2 Isn't that enough ? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet  What more do you want ?
label2 What do you got ?
label2 Magnets : What Do They Stick To ? If the answer is metal  it's not exactly groundbreaking 
label2 Where are we going ?
label2 It'll be good to have him back 
label2 I don't have a problem with Stuart  Besides  he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store 
label2 All right  Pictionary  What are the teams ?
label2 Batman  Batman and Robin  Uh  Wonder Twins plus the monkey  Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman 
label2 In what universe is that a present ?
label2 Nothing with quarks 
label2 How could you miss that ?
label2 Oh  uh  uh  uh  sausage  Uh  uh  uh  uh  bratwurst ? Oh  oh  a hot dog 
label2 A solar system  Uh  uh  uh  uh  um  unidentified flying liverwurst ? I don't '
label2 I don't know  uh  Casper the alcoholic ghost ?
label2 Mmm  in all fairness  Pictionary has verbal skills  visual skills  It's a pretty well-rounded game 
label2 En el acelerador de particulares 
label2 No good  Sheldon doesn't float 
label2 Yeah  that's when it started 
label2 I'm trying  Don't yell at me 
label2 I know what he looks like 
label2 Because he's hard to find  If he was easy to find  the books would be called There's Waldo 
label2 57  58  59  that's one minute 
label2 Remember  show your work 
label2 Get up  we can't lose at math 
label2 Sheldon  we haven't won a game all night  Now  you either stick your face in that pie or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face 
label2 Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space ?
label2 Okay  Hey  Howard  any thoughts on where we should get dinner ?
label2 Oh  what a nice surprise  I don't think you've ever seen my lab before 
label2 No  Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette 
label2 Oh  no  no  no  don't look in there 
label2 No  it's a nitrogen laser  It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg 
label2 Sign right there 
label2 Uh  that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer 
label2 That is a pencil sharpener 
label2 It's actually pretty neat 
label2 Yeah  It's a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking  Here  I'll show you  We'll just put this pencil over here 
label2 You know  there's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram 
label2 Uh-huh  Well  the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really
label2 What ? Here ? Now ?
label2 No  no  It's kind of crazy  I've never fooled around in the lab before 
label2 No  I did have a shot with the Lisatronic  but the extension cord wasn't long enough 
label2 Hello  boys 
label2 Nothing 
label2 Yeah  Oh  uh  you don't have on any jewellery  do you ?
label2 A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings  Now he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size  Now watch this 
label2 Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto 
label2 But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him 
label2 Hello  boys 
label2 Don't worry  this is exactly how you look when you're dancing in clubs 
label2 Sheldon  I don't think this actually means '
label2 It's crunchy  Just the way I like it 
label2 It's great  I love it 
label2 Oh  That's great  Great  great  great  Why wait so long to tell me ?
label2 Why do you think I'd be like that ? I get it  you're taking one class  It's nice  Maybe if it goes well  you take another  you enrol full-time  Ooh  be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college 
label2 Sorry  Whatever  It's all good 
label2 Am I allowed to ask how the class is going ?
label2 Great topic  I can help with that  There are lots of different perspectives you can take  economic  sociological  political 
label2 Can I take a look ?
label2 It's like when I started doing chin-ups  I didn't want you to see until I could do one  FYI  really close 
label2 Really ? ' Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school  that never happened once 
label2 Please be good  Please be good  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Okay  She writes like she cooks 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 I did a bad thing 
label2 Penny started taking a class  She wrote a paper  she didn't want me to read it  I went behind her back and I read it anyway 
label2 Is it possible we're having two different conversations ?
label2 Hang on  Okay  here's what we're gonna do  Chess clock  We each get five minutes to talk about our problems  We'll take turns  Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend  Begin 
label2 He's probably busy  You're worried about nothing  Give it a couple more days  I'm sure he'll play  and you'll see that everything's fine  My turn  I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper  but how do I tell her it's bad without letting her know that I read it ?
label2 Maybe since you're so good  he's taking his time to meet the challenge  I want Penny to enjoy school '
label2 Sheldon  I wasn't done talking  She hands in the paper tomorrow  I know I could help her  And she's my girlfriend  I  I should be allowed to help her  Why aren't I allowed to help her ?
label2 No  You need to give me some advice 
label2 No  specific to my situation 
label2 Empathetic 
label2 I quit 
label2 Good morning  sunshine 
label2 I know  but I have to go to work  and I made you breakfast 
label2 No  no  Listen  um  once upon a time  there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night  elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him  And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning  he  he would be super happy  not mad at the elves at all  Open it 
label2 No  I  I mean  it was good  There were just a few things that needed a little polishing 
label2 That's not true  Uh  slavery  1619  Your name at the top  That's all you 
label2 Please don't be upset  I just  I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school 
label2 I'm sorry  I was just trying to help 
label2 Oh  hey  Haven't heard from you in a couple days  You still mad at me ?
label2 I don't know what to say 
label2 Well answer it  I want to hear 
label2 Hey  look who's out after dark  like a big boy 
label2 I thought you had plans with Amy 
label2 Hold on  Wil and Amy had an argument ?
label2 Then Amy got mad and left ?
label2 Because your friend was rude to her  and then you went to dinner with him 
label2 Keep going  buddy  you're doing great 
label2 They'd say  why does he touch himself so much ?
label2 Oh  yeah  Fifth grade  Sixth grade  Seventh grade  Eighth grade  Ninth grade 
label2 Okay  You want to start loading this stuff into the truck ?
label2 We're not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself 
label2 You know  a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us 
label2 Actually  no  he goes to the bathroom at eight a  m  with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays 
label2 Oh  that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg 
label2 Right  the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life ?
label2 Well  I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection 
label2 Yeah  it was 
label2 Who you talking to ?
label2 Oh  great  We're still dating  right ?
label2 I'm sorry  what was that ? I had a little stroke after oral 
label2 Did you tell him you have a boyfriend ?
label2 Well  maybe you should tell him 
label2 Say  can't talk right now  hanging with my boyfriend  England sucks  you suck  USA number one 
label2 Yes  Thank you 
label2 What did he say ?
label2 I hate this guy 
label2 Come on  trust me  he's hitting on you 
label2 Really ? Here ?
label2 That'd be great  Thank you 
label2 If you're wondering why I've been staring through the peephole  I'm trying to get a look at this guy who's coming over to Penny's 
label2 It's not a big deal  He's just in her history class  They're working on a project together  I don't even know why I care  You know what  I don't care 
label2 This is silly  I have nothing to worry about 
label2 What do you mean ?
label2 Well  yeah  but this isn't just about looks  I'm  I'm way above average in a lot of other things 
label2 I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here 
label2 None of this matters  I trust that Penny cares about me  and nothing's gonna happen with this guy 
label2 Now you're just being ridiculous 
label2 I'll be right back 
label2 Oh  cool  That cute blonde on four ?
label2 Yeah  He's ganged up 
label2 That's the name of his gang  The Scientists  They are crazy 
label2 No problem  brother  Stay frosty 
label2 Hey  Alex  and call me Leonard  Dr  Hofstadter is my father  And my mother  And my sister  And our cat  Although  I'm pretty sure Dr  Boots Hofstadter's degree was honorary 
label2 Hey  Alex  let me ask you something  My girlfriend knows this guy at school  He's got an English accent 
label2 Yeah  you all do  Anyway  I feel like he's hitting on her  She says he's just being nice and that I should trust her 
label2 Right  Because girls are always like  ooh  that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections  I got to get me some of that 
label2 Trust me  it doesn't 
label2 Really ?
label2 Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way 
label2 Come on  I'm sorry 
label2 I do  of course I do 
label2 Oh  You know  I'm really starting to not like this guy 
label2 You know that's the first time you ever said that you love me 
label2 We're just supposed to pretend it's not a big deal ?
label2 You're right  you should go 
label2 Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data  You're just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness 
label2 Oh  yeah ? Mummies are wrapped in bandages 
label2 All right  you brought this on yourself  Sheldon  get him 
label2 You get a cookie  too 
label2 Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it 
label2 Sheldon  let it go  It's not a big deal 
label2 All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother 
label2 Because I can never understand your side 
label2 Sheldon ?
label2 I don't have any 
label2 Howard  what are you doing ?
label2 What are you idiots doing ?
label2 You're both acting like lunatics  It's just a parking spot 
label2 What I don't believe is that you tried to run him over 
label2 Why would it trouble you ? It's  like  your third favourite cartoon theme song 
label2 Oh  Like Jaws 4  Indiana Jones 4  Daredevil 1 
label2 Penny's working tonight  I'm in 
label2 Fun  We know how much you love that 
label2 That should lighten the mood 
label2 Raj is probably right  You should get someone to give you some pointers 
label2 I'm no expert  but I think the hook has to go through the worm 
label2 My dad was an anthropologist  The only father-son time he spent was with a 2000- year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy  I hated that kid 
label2 Look at that  I built a fireplace with my own two hands 
label2 Aw  I got a little paper cut 
label2 Oh  before I forget  Saturday I'm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys 
label2 Oh  come on  I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore 
label2 Little bit  yeah 
label2 All right  Sheldon  to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you 
label2 Okay  here we go  You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa's village  Clearly  a great battle has taken place 
label2 Okay  there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow  Sheldon  what do you do ?
label2 Okay  you run into a room full of weapons  hit a trip wire  a cannon blows your face off  you die  you're out of the game 
label2 Okay  come on  moving on 
label2 Yeah  sorry  Uh  you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest  What do you do ? And  Howard  do not say  I feel up the large chest 
label2 Great  What do you do ?
label2 Walls are getting closer 
label2 You're ten seconds away from getting crushed  Nine  eight 
label2 Seven  six 
label2 Three  two 
label2 The walls are getting slower 
label2 The walls stop  You're safe 
label2 Okay  continuing our quest 
label2 Okay  you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen 
label2 I don't know  What's the difference ?
label2 Fine  You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen  There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water 
label2 You see those  too 
label2 No  it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage  Pretty Christmassy 
label2 Come on  Sheldon  You know all the Christmas stories  and the carols  you've got an eggnog moustache going on there  Just admit it  You're getting a little Yuletide spirit 
label2 Honestly  because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now 
label2 I grew up in a house full of crazy academics  Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies  we had to leave him a research paper  And in the morning  you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded 
label2 It wasn't amazing  I got a C-minus four years in a row 
label2 The drawbridge is lowering 
label2 You did it  The drawbridge is down  You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room  And in the corner  chained to the wall  you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus  He says  ho  ho  help me 
label2 Uh  okay 
label2 This is weird  right ?
label2 Okay  So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed  Santa's dead  and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend 
label2 I can't blame you  Tiny Twister was a complete bust 
label2 What recordings ?
label2 Hey  Just playing a little Giant Jenga here 
label2 Well  most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done  How about you ?
label2 Ooh  That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam  That should be great 
label2 Ah  I'd love to  but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny 
label2 Well  she's not really into that kind of stuff 
label2 Are we done with this ?
label2 Terrific  Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it 
label2 Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night 
label2 Working it ? You can't even talk to her 
label2 She knows I have a girlfriend  It's so weird 
label2 To my bones  I mean  I'm not gonna do anything about it  I love Penny  It's just nice to have a young  attractive woman sniffing around the goods 
label2 I'm androgynous ?
label2 What do you guys think I should do ?
label2 Hey  pretty lady 
label2 Uh  I guess I am 
label2 I don't know  just having a good day  This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work  so I got to listen to the radio  That was pretty crazy 
label2 Oh  It  Was 
label2 Yeah  And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl 
label2 Um  why would I mean Alex ?
label2 I'm missing something  ( Enters apartment  To Sheldon ) Did you say something to Penny about Alex ?
label2 Why would you do that ?
label2 At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend 
label2 Oh  my God  what did you do ?
label2 Please forgive me  I should have told you about Alex 
label2 Of course not  No  Why ?
label2 You do that ?
label2 Hang on  Are you feeling insecure ? Because that's my thing  and if you take it away  I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship 
label2 No  I'm not happy 
label2 I'm sorry  I just never think of you having feelings like that 
label2 Why ? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex 
label2 With all these women chasing me  I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk 
label2 Message received  Ah  excuse me  ( Answering phone ) Hello  This is Dr  Hofstadter  Okay  All right  thank you  That's weird  I'm getting called in to Human Resources 
label2 I don't know 
label2 Sheldon threw us all under the bus 
label2 How is this my fault ?
label2 I wasn't screwing around with anyone 
label2 Yes  but I think this is all a big misunderstanding 
label2 Oh  would you stop worrying about that ?
label2 That's great 
label2 Glasses ? I really don't think that's gonna change ' oh  my God  you look so smart and hot 
label2 Okay  come with me 
label2 To my bedroom  so I can take everything off but those glasses  And maybe the boots 
label2 Hey  will you steam my uniform next ?
label2 Hey  hey  hey  hey  This is my Comic-Con makeup  I love you  but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend 
label2 That was San Diego Comic-Con  This is Bakersfield Comic-Con 
label2 Well  it's a lot smaller  It's more about the comic books  The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood 
label2 Oh  hang on a second 
label2 To show people when they don't believe me 
label2 It is on 
label2 What did you do ?
label2 Counterpoint  no  it's not 
label2 Really ?
label2 Yeah  that sounds fun 
label2 I don't believe this 
label2 Mine  too  Anybody got any ideas ?
label2 What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight ?
label2 Look at us  Sheldon  We're the crazy people 
label2 Come on  let's just start walking  There's got to be a gas station or something nearby 
label2 Please  Sheldon  I am so not in the mood 
label2 Can I use your phone ? Our car got stolen 
label2 Our clothes  our wallets  phones 
label2 Uh  we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield  They have a big costume contest  It's cooler than it sounds 
label2 Are you kidding me ? After all we've been through  I just want to go home 
label2 No  that can't be right 
label2 I say we investigate 
label2 Fine  but set them to stun  If we vaporize Penny  I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again 
label2 Sheldon  your food's getting cold 
label2 Oh  this is neat  Think about all the action figures we've bought over the years  It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us  Don't you think ?
label2 Yeah  so  I'm out 
label2 You get that these are personalised action figures 
label2 Hmm  Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette 
label2 A thousand dollars on action figures ? How can you afford that ?
label2 Maybe it's a shipping problem 
label2 Yeah  Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys 
label2 Aw  and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one  Look at my face  Do I look smug ? I feel smug 
label2 Well  sometimes there's a secret ending  like in The Avengers 
label2 They could show bloopers  Oh  no 
label2 That is Sheldon's ' I'm unhappy and about to destroy the planet ' music  Come on  let's just go to your place 
label2 Shouldn't we talk to him ? Have you learned nothing in six years ?
label2 So  cocoa ?
label2 Oh  teacher ! Me ! Me !
label2 Oh  no  no  no  I know this  Uh  hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks ?
label2 Come on  Sheldon  we're going to be late 
label2 You're not sick  You just don't want to face Kripke 
label2 What did you do  put this in your tea ?
label2 Sheldon Lee Cooper  I do not have time for this nonsense  Now  go put your clothes on  get in the car  and lets go to work 
label2 Is my coitus whimsically inventive ?
label2 I know you're joking  but I'd be okay with that 
label2 We don't ask Sheldon things like that 
label2 All right  we're down the rabbit hole  What are you doing ?
label2 Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you 
label2 I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long  These are great  I just started number six 
label2 Why would you say that ?
label2 What is wrong with you ? If I did that  you'd bitch about it for weeks 
label2 Hissy fits ? I have hissy fits ?
label2 You are unbelievable  I don't know why I put up with you  You're controlling  you're irritating 
label2 You know what ? Screw you  Sheldon  You are the most annoying person I have ever met 
label2 That's it  I don't  I don't have to put up with this 
label2 To live with Penny and not you  you crazy bastard 
label2 I swear  that man is the most egotistical  insufferable human being I have ever met 
label2 Well  I've had it  I am done  I can't  I can't live with him for one more minute 
label2 I was thinking here with you 
label2 That a problem ?
label2 Harry and Ginny get together ?
label2 Please  the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy  his  his stooge  his doormat 
label2 Wow  It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together 
label2 Is it ? We're together all the time  Financially  it makes great sense  Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this ?
label2 Great  I'll go get my stuff 
label2 Oh  could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom ? I take a lot of medicine 
label2 Is that so ?
label2 Cut to the chase  Sheldon 
label2 Oh  get this  suddenly  Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him 
label2 Well  if he doesn't want to live with her  then he should tell her how he feels 
label2 I'm sorry  Sheldon  I can't help you  Oh  spoiler alert  this door's about to slam in your face 
label2 Since when don't you want to live with me ?
label2 You're kidding  Did you Heimlich him ?
label2 You're a hero 
label2 Oh  yeah  speaking of work  do you know if you have Thursday night off ?
label2 What do you mean  why ? It's Valentine's Day 
label2 You could be a little more into it 
label2 Okay  well  this time it's going to be different  Because I am like a romance ninja  You don't see it coming  and then bam  romance  watch out  hearts  kisses  love  ooh-ya !
label2 Hey  you coming to lunch ?
label2 What you looking at ?
label2 Oh  that's cool 
label2 Oh  wow 
label2 Oh  I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner 
label2 Want to come to dinner with us ?
label2 Waugh  romance ninja 
label2 Mmm  would you like some wine ?
label2 Trying to have a magical night here  guys 
label2 You're kidding 
label2 I know it's not ideal  but don't let them ruin our night 
label2 Two can play this game  Penny '
label2 All right 
label2 Isn't it kind of nice ? I mean  he was with the wrong person  and now he found the right person 
label2 You know what ? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day ?
label2 I thought we were letting it go 
label2 Um  it did end happy for you  You're here with me 
label2 Oh  I'm not  It's about you 
label2 This one does  and you're the reason why 
label2 I'm not saying that 
label2 Okay  you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that 
label2 Okay  I know I propose a lot  So how about this ? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again 
label2 No  No  no  no  no  But if someday you decide you want to get married  you have to propose to me 
label2 Yes  It's all on you  But I got to tell you  when the time comes  I want the whole nine yards  I want you down on one knee  flowers  I want to be swept off my feet 
label2 And I'm cool with surprises  But nothing on a Jumbotron  I don't want to cry on a big screen like that 
label2 Don't look under that rock 
label2 Come on  buddy  open up 
label2 Nope  just  just  whoa 
label2 Raj  what's going on ?
label2 Yeah  you can't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life 
label2 Lobsters overnight ?
label2 The surf and turf sounds good  See if they have corn on the cob 
label2 So  Amy  what's going on with your addiction study ?
label2 You know why  The Nintendo DS  And the PSP  Now the Gameboy 
label2 Well  is that all of it ?
label2 She's pretty good  huh ?
label2 She really is 
label2 Look  I know you guys don't want to do this  but we have no choice  So  you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with 
label2 Yeah  well  it's in our contract to serve on a university committee  And frankly  this is one I believe in  Okay  here we go  Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences 
label2 Helping women ? Y
label2 Oh  like yesterday  when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners  the pharmacy and the post office ?
label2 You don't think it's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science 
label2 You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive  but a black lady still answered the space phone ?
label2 Yes  I know  you're too smart for this 
label2 Guys  please don't make this a school project where I'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch 
label2 Guys  our topic is encouraging women in science  can you at least play a less sexist game
label2 That's actually good  Why didn't I think of that ?
label2 I wonder if there's a way we could give the idea a trial run 
label2 That's great  try to set up something for the three of us to go over there 
label2 It's nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students 
label2 And now you're also an astronaut 
label2 Okay  who's ready for some science ? Me  too  Okay  I am Dr  Leonard Hofstadter  I am here with my friends Dr  Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz  and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be  How cool  you ask ? Well  how about negative 273 degrees  ' cause that's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value  Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it ? What ? All right  So now let's bring out theoretical physicist Dr  Sheldon Cooper 
label2 I never wanted to play the cello  How do you meet girls playing the cello ? Hey  you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee ?
label2 Hey  how was your ' what ?
label2 I had no choice  He kept kicking the back of my seat 
label2 Sheldon  come on  It's getting late  Time to go 
label2 That's what you said five minutes ago  Amy and Penny are already in the car  Let's move it 
label2 Sheldon  it's  wait  I can go home without you ? Bye 
label2 You know  when I first met Howard  he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say  aw  I sat in gum 
label2 Well  it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now  Happily married guy throwing dinner parties 
label2 Trying to paint a picture 
label2 Mm  you know  we could throw a dinner party  too  Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up 
label2 Actually  all I did was invite you 
label2 I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch  Penny and I just want to do something low-key  You know  cocktails  light jazz music  hors d'oeuvres 
label2 Hey  where have you been ?
label2 One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  I meant  golly  Sheldon  you've been gone a long time 
label2 Fine  then that 
label2 As is the company 
label2 Hey  uh  listen  everybody  Before Howard gets here  et's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father 
label2 Same here 
label2 You know  too 
label2 Raj  you're up 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Okay  my turn  Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing  and that you should never throw it away like he did 
label2 Bernadette 
label2 So  which one do you think it is  matey ?
label2 Yeah  cool 
label2 Yeah  I think so 
label2 I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies  Instead  it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again 
label2 Oh  my God 
label2 No  I mean  I'll apply  but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics 
label2 Excuse me  but I think I'm just as qualified as you are 
label2 Mm  not really 
label2 I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech 
label2 Oh  very  Assuming she takes my call 
label2 Thank you  I'm a naive idiot  right ?
label2 Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey  Mrs  Davis 
label2 Yeah  Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season 
label2 Not that you need it  I bet you look great in a swimsuit 
label2 I've got what my father used to call furniture disease  My chest is falling into my drawers  I'm not  uh  familiar with this model  How do I make it start ?
label2 Right  This one might be broken 
label2 Well  I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants  I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'll be throwing my hat in the ring 
label2 Well  look at that  Burned a whole calorie 
label2 Oh  if you  if you like banana bread  I've got a-a great recipe  The trick is in  in fresh ground  I'll e-mail it to you 
label2 Call someone 
label2 Gentlemen 
label2 Nurse's office 
label2 Asthma  heart  some kind of attack  I'm fine  though 
label2 Probably not 
label2 Oh  that's nice  but it-it's just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I'm not sure how much help you'd be 
label2 Oh  yeah  No  Thanks  that would be great help  You realize you might kill some of them 
label2 Way to hit ' em with both barrels 
label2 Okay  okay  Guys  what are we doing here ?
label2 Oh  you do what you want  but I don't want to lose my friends over tenure  Friends are forever 
label2 I'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself 
label2 How about it  Sheldon ?
label2 No  We cannot lose to that jerk 
label2 Yeah  Uh  maybe we were hacked  You know  the Chinese have been hacking everything lately 
label2 I don't know  It's a fat guy on a Segway  That's funny everywhere 
label2 You know  if you're trying to make space on the DVR  why don't you just get rid of some of the stuff you've already watched ? Like  um  Alphas 
label2 There is no season three  They cancelled that show 
label2 They did 
label2 Oh  please  don't do that 
label2 With all the TV Sheldon was talking about  I had the greatest idea ever  It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca's  You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer  It is the perfect show for the two of us  It's got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance  I cannot oversell this  What do you say ?
label2 I thought you grew up on a farm 
label2 So  did you love it ? Of course you loved it  How could you not love it ? Tell me how much you loved it 
label2 Oh  don't say cute  That's the worst 
label2 It just makes things seem small  It diminishes them 
label2 You can try  but nobody's gonna believe you  I just  I don't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it 
label2 Well  then  tell your face 
label2 You know what ? Never mind  We gave it a shot  Let's just see what else is on 
label2 Really ?
label2 All right  cool  I think you'll like the next one better  All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse 
label2 The Harmony One was fine  We didn't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred  which he knows is too big for my hand 
label2 Oh  my cute little tushy strikes again 
label2 Those things can still happen 
label2 That's a big deal 
label2 So  does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con ?
label2 The interface is pretty simple  You put your horizontal X coordinate here  vertical Y coordinate here  When you're happy with those  you press this button 
label2 You're kidding  He's still alive ?
label2 He was the host of this great ' Hey !
label2 Hire him to do what ?
label2 It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him  I just used awesome wrong  didn't I ?
label2 Do you remember his old theme song ?
label2 You're kidding 
label2 And he wrote him a cheque 
label2 Well  I can  so shut up 
label2 That's not ridiculous  Good night 
label2 Where is he ?
label2 Mr  Jeffries  I am so sorry  We should've told you about the broken elevator 
label2 Mr  Jeffries  I'm  I'm Leonard  This is my girlfriend  Penny 
label2 Yes  sir 
label2 We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life 
label2 That's too bad  But still  working with kids  it must be rewarding 
label2 Then what is it ?
label2 I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science  In a way  their discoveries are your discoveries 
label2 You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance ?
label2 I'm sorry things turned out this way 
label2 Oh  that's nice  But relax  sometimes change is good  Uh  you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock  but you wound up liking him 
label2 See  Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am 
label2 Hey  hey  hey  you can't leave  We just started 
label2 I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way 
label2 Hey  I always did sound effects  A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon 
label2 No  no  no  Amy  wait  I know it's not the night you had in mind  but why don't you guys stay and play with us ? It'll be fun 
label2 All right  Amy  there's one ogre left  Take him out 
label2 All right  Amy  it's your turn  We need one more hit  Finish him off 
label2 Ooh ! Sorry  I thought you were gonna do that 
label2 Hey  you guys have been in there for a while  You doing okay ?
label2 Oh  that sounds romantic 
label2 So  are we ever gonna hang out with this girl ?
label2 I have a job 
label2 He knows  wow 
label2 Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat 
label2 I know what you're doing  You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Look  I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness  If I get the chance to do this  there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me 
label2 Oh  that's awful 
label2 Anyway  Stephen Hawking's team is looking into that  and I've been invited to join them 
label2 Well  it is  Just  you know  I'd be gone for a while 
label2 Three  four months 
label2 Uh  he's not gonna be there  He's just sending a team to research his theory 
label2 Yeah  And I'm a little worried because things between us have been so great  and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up 
label2 Okay  I'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning 
label2 Sheldon's nervous about me leaving  Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone 
label2 Really  you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party 
label2 There's beer in the fridge  Anyway  you guys really don't need to make a big deal 
label2 Oh  Thank you  Raj  I'd be honoured 
label2 I know  As far as science goes  this is the adventure of a lifetime 
label2 It's not a competition 
label2 Thank you  Sheldon  That must've been very hard for you to say 
label2 Yep  I'm really gonna miss you 
label2 Would you just relax ?
label2 I'm covered 
label2 Calm down  I'm getting out  I have something I want to give you 
label2 I love you  too 
label2 What is it ?
label2 Sheldon  I got to go inside  It's getting rough out here 
label2 What was what ?
label2 Penny ? Hey  it's Penny  Everybody say hi to Penny 
label2 Best time of my life 
label2 Is it ? Hey  everybody  it's five thirty in the morning !
label2 Uh-oh  hang on 
label2 No  it's a drinking game  Whenever we see an iceberg  we take a shot !
label2 Keep your voice down 
label2 Uh  sure  that's why I did it 
label2 And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat 
label2 And  oh  that's me getting rescued after I fell in 
label2 And I'm gonna hit the head  That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee 
label2 I'm sorry  Sheldon  I should've told you I was back  I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny 
label2 I actually have used those exact words before  In that order 
label2 The what ?
label2 Come on  I said I was sorry 
label2 Come on  this is silly  Hey  um  I brought you back a little present from my trip  huh ? It's that sailor cap that you wanted  It's neat  huh ?
label2 I don't  I really don't  Just try it on  Oh  yeah 
label2 Good morning 
label2 So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me ?
label2 No  I don't 
label2 Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't ?
label2 Hey  I said I was sorry  What else do you want from me ?
label2 Fine  What I did was wrong 
label2 You know what ? I'm not driving you to work  because you're incredibly annoying 
label2 So now we're just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched  but the numbers look pretty promising 
label2 You know what ? You're a crazy person 
label2 I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show  turns out it was the weights 
label2 And no one told me ?
label2 Oh  yeah  We were meaning to do that 
label2 We did them at Princeton  too 
label2 Oh  these are a little different  There's a tradition at elite universities '
label2 A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge  science 
label2 I think it sounds fun 
label2 You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley ?
label2 It's not funny 
label2 Couples sounds great  Or we could mix things up  Maybe pick names out of a hat  Whatever 
label2 I just said  couples sound great 
label2 Stop yelling at me 
label2 Do you think Penny's mad at me ?
label2 I have asthma  Back off 
label2 Hey  Penny  I just wanted to say good luck  and I hope there's no hard feelings 
label2 Relax  it's a hard puzzle  It's gonna take a while to solve 
label2 Wait  I got it  I got it /
label2 You're really mean  you know that ?
label2 Uh-huh  Like death ?
label2 This stupid game is why she's mad in the first place  I'm telling her I'm quitting 
label2 What does she think I am ?
label2 I can't believe she would say that about me 
label2 Almost 
label2 The clue must be in the bag 
label2 It's just a bunch of pants 
label2 Well  why would you want to be on someone's team who you like to call a  I can't even say it in front of Sheldon 
label2 You know exactly what I'm talking about 
label2 Why would you do that ?
label2 Hey  I am every bit as much of a man as Penny  Now  let's do this 
label2 This one is  too 
label2 Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot ?
label2 Are you kidding me ?
label2 Yeah  but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don't need me there to make it awkward  They have each other for that  So  how was school ?
label2 Oh  come on  Not that book  It  it's got  like  every horrible story from my childhood in it 
label2 Seriously  please find another book 
label2 There  there's chapters about potty training  and bed-wetting and masturbation  Basically  if something came out of me  she wrote about it  You know what ? Do whatever you want  just don't talk to me about it 
label2 Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice ?
label2 Actually  they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion  Without him  they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place 
label2 They weren't boobies  they were muscles  And the make-up was green  I was pretending to be The Hulk 
label2 That was to keep my muscles from sagging  Can we please stop talking about this ?
label2 Okay  fine  Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk ? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house 
label2 Gee  I don't know  Maybe it's because I was always the subject of her little experiments  Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking ? The answer  by the way  June 
label2 I do  too  but there's not 
label2 Of course  who am I to argue with a check-plus student ? Just warning you  I'm gonna go right  Don't make a big deal out of it 
label2 Whatcha doin ' ?
label2 So you're looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages ?
label2 I'll see you later  I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny 
label2 I gotta go 
label2 You ready to go ?
label2 Well  you're  you're right  Let's just go 
label2 Nothing  I'm fine 
label2 No  Not everything is about my mom 
label2 That sounds nice  Yeah 
label2 Or  you know  we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track  On account of how sad I am about my mom 
label2 One sec  Hey  Sorry 
label2 I'll try  but I might be sad again tonight 
label2 Who just had sex with me at work 
label2 Well  whenever I talk about how awful my mom was  Penny will do anything to make me feel better 
label2 Look  I mean  I'm not proud of it  but it does work  I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python  Even I was bored  I just wanted to see if she'd make it to the end 
label2 Hey  I was just ' what is happening ?
label2 Oh  oh  I have  So bad 
label2 Oh  please  Mommy  No  Mommy 
label2 I didn't dream that ?
label2 Although  technically  Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied  He couldn't even get that done 
label2 Yeah  I know 
label2 Please let me be there when you tell her that 
label2 Please  oh  please  just let me be there 
label2 Nailed it 
label2 That was kind of icy  You two okay ?
label2 Smart  Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj's hair 
label2 I did not 
label2 I thought Amy was gonna drive you home 
label2 Doesn't matter 
label2 Doesn't matter 
label2 Laser's warmed up 
label2 No  no  what are you doing ? He's both happy and quiet  It's like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time 
label2 It's really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette 
label2 And besides  I do romantic things for you all the time  Can you even name one romantic thing you've done for me ?
label2 Sex doesn't count 
label2 Well  I took you there  All you did was '
label2 It's fine  And also not true 
label2 That's beautiful  Is that Shakespeare ?
label2 He'll figure it out when he falls off the roof 
label2 Sheldon  I know you're in the zone  but do you want some tea ? All right  I can't believe I'm gonna say this  but you haven't spoken in hours and I'm starting to get worried  Please say something 
label2 Nope  it was better before 
label2 Holy crap  Sheldon  did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element ?
label2 Yeah  definitely better before 
label2 If by cool you mean willing to  yes  If by cool you mean cool  clearly you've never seen me play the cello 
label2 Sheldon  that's incredible 
label2 Good to know 
label2 : You got to stop beating yourself up over this  I mean  you made a mistake  but it was a happy mistake 
label2 Buddy  I don't think you can  I mean  once it's out there  it's out there  This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape 
label2 We'll be there 
label2 I will not 
label2 Invite them to live with us 
label2 Yeah  It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic 
label2 Actually  it can be  but I told you sex doesn't count 
label2 Oh  my God  is she okay ?
label2 Oh  no 
label2 I have to say  this is the best Top Ramen you've ever made 
label2 Oh  rose petals 
label2 You made the bed ? You really are pulling out all the stops 
label2 Oh  wow 
label2 This is great  It  thank you  it's  so much 
label2 Nothing  I love it 
label2 No  no  it's okay  It's really thoughtful 
label2 I can't believe you saved all this stuff 
label2 Is that a pregnancy test ?
label2 That's because you've never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day 
label2 Oh  Gas-X has a new ultra strength  I guess they really do read their mail 
label2 Oh  yeah 
label2 He thinks there's a difference 
label2 Dr  Jeffries  hello again  Leonard Hofstadter 
label2 No  she's not 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Hey  Sheldon  let's go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine  you love that 
label2 What's up ?
label2 Hey  I got an email from Professor Proton 
label2 If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton  I would not have believed you 
label2 I'm sorry  Dr  Jeffries  I'm just excited  This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is  it's really interesting 
label2 Mr  Nye  hello  I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense 
label2 Oh  uh  we're making nano vacuum tubes 
label2 Okay  we're almost ready to go  Once we bond the wires  we can test the tubes 
label2 Oh  God 
label2 Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies 
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 Oh  uh  you know  because we're friends 
label2 Wow  you ask really hard questions 
label2 Look  I know he can be aggravating  but what you have to remember is that he's not doing it on purpose  It's just how he is  But he's also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together 
label2 He did bite me once  But in his defence  I came up behind him while he was eating  so '
label2 You know what  Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met  And he's a little broken and he needs me  I guess I need him  too 
label2 He can't help it  He can't  He really can't 
label2 Oh  uh  we played  once  I broke a window 
label2 Skee-Ball tickets ?
label2 Yup  oh  here you go 
label2 Oh  I forgot about this  My aunt made it for me when I started college 
label2 Hmm  I think I got them all  Nope  they're not in there 
label2 Okay  okay  I'm gonna show you what's in the box  But just promise not to flip out 
label2 I'm sorry  I'll  I'll take care of it 
label2 I mean it  I'm going to 
label2 And you're going to stay calm ?
label2 How about that ? Sheldon's being reasonable 
label2 So  when you say you're not going to freak out about the DVD  here's what that means  Don't fixate on it  Don't wake me up in the middle of the night  Or nag me through the door while I'm on the toilet 
label2 When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there  You ever try that ? Maybe go in through the ear ?
label2 That's stupid  Why ?
label2 I'm telling you  try the hanger 
label2 Really ?
label2 It's called proving a point 
label2 Monday morning I'll go downtown  look up the owner's information and send him the DVD  Pay the late fee  and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic  Ah !
label2 Well  Sheldon  it took me all morning  but I found the owner of the video store  And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep  drunk at the bottom of a pool  Anyway  there is no one to return the DVD to  so this issue is resolved  Ah ! And I'd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable  I didn't use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me 
label2 Or it's resolved 
label2 There's a principle at stake 
label2 Oh  I don't know  Who cares ? Look at me 
label2 No  no  honey  if I take it off  Sheldon wins 
label2 No  it's  it's almost done  I just  I have to find the next of kin  and send ' em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft 
label2 What is that ? What is that for ?
label2 Oh  oh  no  no  It's because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held  According to Father Solakian  no one attended  Luckily  my trip wasn't a complete waste  I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I'm not Armenian  so it probably won't work  This is over  right ?
label2 Listen to me  Sheldon  I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie 
label2 Why isn't this bothering you ? Isn't your brain getting itchy ? This is on your card  This could be ruining your credit score  Why isn't this making you crazy ?
label2 The math is all there  It's not real 
label2 Were you drunk ?
label2 It'd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day 
label2 I want to go 
label2 You did ?
label2 Wait  you went to a chapel ?
label2 Penny  you know those are real  right ?
label2 Yeah  they are 
label2 Yeah  they are 
label2 Well  a goof or not  you're actually married  You need to get this taken care of 
label2 I'm hoping you can get an annulment  It's just like it never happened 
label2 Okay  I found the  uh  court papers that you and Zack need to fill out  I'll print them when we get home 
label2 Why are you mad at me ? You're the one that did the stupid thing  I'm just trying to fix it 
label2 Wuh  Penny 
label2 Wait  you invited him here ?
label2 I just don't understand why you invited him here today 
label2 Well  you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack 
label2 Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday 
label2 Yeah  uh  you guys have to sign here and here  On Monday  we'll file for the annulment  and this marriage will be over 
label2 Why won't you sign it ?
label2 You married him instead of me ? Good call  Sign the papers 
label2 That is not true 
label2 You're the one who invited him here 
label2 I'm sorry  too 
label2 Of course you're not  People love trained monkeys 
label2 Hey  you're in a good mood 
label2 Yes  Do you know what that means ? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away 
label2 No  it's all over 
label2 Well  you're welcome 
label2 Oh  there is no winning with you  And koalas and otters don't even live near each other 
label2 The  the element never existed  I didn't take it away  science took it away  Be mad at science 
label2 Will you tell him he's out of his mind 
label2 Okay  Sheldon  what do you want me to do  hide the information ? If I don't publish it  it's just a matter of time before someone else does 
label2 Hey  I just wanted to let you know that I  I posted my findings 
label2 These things happen all the time  Sheldon 
label2 It's not a big deal 
label2 Okay  Barry  that's enough 
label2 I can't believe they kicked you out 
label2 Oh  relax  she's in her crate  She can't get out 
label2 Thanks 
label2 He asked me 
label2 As I was saying '
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Where ?
label2 Is someone sick ?
label2 Well  congrats  and it's nice you're gonna be there for your sister 
label2 And I'm happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars 
label2 But it is what you got me last year 
label2 And last night 
label2 Hey  buddy 
label2 You don't know that  I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years  I could have picked her up 
label2 I'm gonna do it  I'm gonna ask her out 
label2 Watch me 
label2 I  uh  ah  um  I '
label2 You guys are making me nervous 
label2 I will  Excuse me 
label2 Hi  uh  um  I'm Leonard ?
label2 No  I am he  Uh  any  anyway  um  there's been something I've wanted to ask you for a long time  Um 
label2 Eh  uh  well  I was wondering  if you're not too busy  um  uh  if  if you'd be interested in telling me where the restroom is ?
label2 Come on  I would not have peed my pants 
label2 But  you forget  I did ask you out in real life 
label2 You know  maybe you and I wouldn't be together  but you wouldn't have done so great yourself 
label2 Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would've ended up with 
label2 The end 
label2 Hey  Sheldon sent us all an e-mail  Happy holidays from Texas  And there's pictures  Aah ! Don't open them  Do not open them 
label2 Disagree 
label2 That's enough 
label2 We talked about it  but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom 
label2 Oh  this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies ' man 
label2 ard : Coming 
label2 Hang on  Why would I be fat ?
label2 ard : What do you want to do for dessert ?
label2 ard : No  there's not 
label2 I'm telling you  Sheldon cares for you more than you think 
label2 Hang on  I'm gonna give you a little early Christmas present  I'm gonna show you something  but if you ever told Sheldon he'd probably never speak to me again  So  if you want to tell him  that's fine  Look 
label2 He made you his screensaver 
label2 Oh  well  it's you  Swamp Thing  Stephen Hawking  Spider-Man  but  look  you're in the mix 
label2 Oh  Madame Curie 
label2 ard : I'm gonna do it  I'm gonna ask her out 
label2 ard : Uh  your phone number and one more cheesecake 
label2 Absolutely 
label2 What happened ?
label2 What ? That's great  Guys 
label2 That's amazing 
label2 So it  it's just flirting ?
label2 Uh  no reason  I just think it's sexier when things are left to the imagination 
label2 Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue ?
label2 It's a joke 
label2 No  Do you ?
label2 I take it back  That was funny 
label2 You know  I think we're zeroing in on your problem 
label2 Are you set on people laughing with you ? ' Cause if you're cool with at you '
label2 I'm so proud of you 
label2 What's wrong ?
label2 Oh  Penny  I'm  I'm sorry 
label2 How you doing ?
label2 You still got the part  That's a huge accomplishment 
label2 Honestly ?
label2 I don't 
label2 I don't know  I got all confused when you said honestly 
label2 Look  do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful ? Of course I do  But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented  just as beautiful ? All right  look  we'll come back to that 
label2 That is not what I said  Look  I think you're really good  I truly do  But this is an incredibly hard thing that you're shooting for  I mean  the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one 
label2 Hey  Can we talk ?
label2 That was really crappy of me  What you're trying to do is hard  but people do make it  and I really do believe you could be one of them 
label2 And to show you how much I believe in you  I kind of got you an audition 
label2 There's this thing online  you put yourself on tape and just send it in  anyone can do it 
label2 So ? Even if it is  you have a huge advantage because you're an actual actress  Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds  Wolowitz sent his in two days ago 
label2 Well  I don't think you called it idiotic 
label2 Come on  It's okay 
label2 No  you're not 
label2 Okay  listen to me  this is just a minor setback 
label2 Well  you have me 
label2 Look  you know I love you but  but you're  you're drunk and sad and feeling lost 
label2 Really not a good time 
label2 Penny  don't 
label2 To my room 
label2 Penny proposed  and I didn't say yes 
label2 That's a good question 
label2 I don't know 
label2 Because I'm afraid to know the answer 
label2 That's it ? You're not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment ?
label2 Did you just put a kick me sign on my back ?
label2 I know 
label2 Oh  my God  they're just making you use your vacation days 
label2 Okay  listen  I don't mean to diminish what you're going through  but I'm a little distracted right now 
label2 It doesn't 
label2 I'm gonna go talk to Penny 
label2 Look  if you want to break up  just say it 
label2 No  no  no  no  I take it back  Don't say it  Just  just hate me  but stay with me  It worked for my parents 
label2 Oh  Oh  okay  Good  good  So  it's cool if I cry a little ?
label2 Look  I get it  and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do 
label2 So  well  before making any rash '
label2 And I support you 
label2 Oh  Sheldon  stay 
label2 I said stay  I'm going to work  Do not follow me 
label2 I don't know  She already thinks I don't support this  so if I call  it might look like I'm checking up on her 
label2 Of course I do  She's a great actress  I'm proud she's taking this risk 
label2 You bought that ? Great  I got to call her before I forget how I said it  Hey 
label2 Oh  how's it going ? You taking Hollywood by storm ?
label2 You got your job back  That is great news  I didn't want to say anything  but you are making the right choice  To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane 
label2 And I support you 
label2 Oh  hey 
label2 How did she get you to do yoga ?
label2 Oh  how many times do I have to say it ? I support you 
label2 Fine  I'm not sure you should have quit  But if you care so much what I think  why didn't you ask me before you did it ?
label2 Yes  I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together  If I'm wrong  then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we're actually in 
label2 Can we please have some privacy ?
label2 For some reason  we're planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever 
label2 I swear  I am on your side 
label2 Listen  I could never do what you're doing  okay ? I would be terrified 
label2 My point is  just because I couldn't do it doesn't mean you shouldn't  And I'm proud of you 
label2 Oh  I've got butterflies 
label2 Hey  We're about to buy tickets for Comic-Con 
label2 Well  this is it  this is it  This is it 
label2 Not yet 
label2 I did it  I did it  I'm in the queue 
label2 Uh  fifteen '
label2 ' thousand two hundred and eleven 
label2 Oh  Thursday's gone  Just Sunday left 
label2 Sunday's gone 
label2 Do what you want  We're getting scalped tickets 
label2 The same way I know that the people in the TV set can't see me 
label2 Did you tell them that you're holding your convention at a Marie Callender's  and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie ?
label2 Look  even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time 
label2 Good luck 
label2 Mmm  what if we go as The Fantastic Four  and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us 
label2 Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape ?
label2 Maybe this isn't a good idea 
label2 Hold on  We always do this 
label2 Chicken out  We're  we're so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong 
label2 Even Batman breaks the rules 
label2 I say  this one time  instead of wimping out  let's be badasses 
label2 Howard  you in on this ?
label2 Name one 
label2 A little 
label2 Good  This is exciting 
label2 Yeah  What if we do get caught  who cares ? So we get banned from Comic-Con 
label2 I wonder if we'd have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants 
label2 Plus  I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from  What ? It's a joke  Oh  come on  We bust on each other  I wear dorky glasses  you might have a problem  it's all for laughs 
label2 We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon 
label2 Ooh  flowers and chocolates ? Somebody's trying to get me out of my panties 
label2 It gets better  Instead of me  you can take someone who will actually enjoy it 
label2 Thank you  Seriously  please don't make me go 
label2 Mm  don't have to  we have the whole place to ourselves 
label2 Hey  Cinnamon  guess who just did it human style 
label2 It's a little late  but I'll take it 
label2 I don't have a vet  I have a podiatrist  an optometrist  an allergist  a dermatologist  a urologist  You'd think I'd have a vet 
label2 Okay  Koothrappali was right  We should have let her watch 
label2 Well  to be fair  you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me 
label2 Really ? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were ?
label2 Oh  no  come on  It was a while  It was a while 
label2 They've been in there  like  half an hour 
label2 How long should we stay ?
label2 How's she doing ?
label2 Yes  thank you for all your help 
label2 Oh  hey  You're back  How was your trip ?
label2 Great  What did you do ?
label2 Additional data  You dog 
label2 Oh  Wait  then what is it if you just have hair up here ?
label2 Moo-stache 
label2 Moo-stache 
label2 Oh  I'm sorry 
label2 I know you don't like change  but it's not a terrible idea 
label2 Hey  Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table  You want to come with us ?
label2 Are you really gonna sit here all day ?
label2 If you'll recall  the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway 
label2 Oh  hang on  Check your in-box 
label2 Nary an argument ? Nary ?
label2 No  Sheldon doesn't like reclaimed wood 
label2 He's afraid the original owners will come back 
label2 Well  he is here  So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller  there's nothing I can do about it 
label2 I know  but '
label2 You're right  I mean  he decides what TV shows we watch  what food we eat  who my favourite hobbit is  I wanted Frodo  but we can't both have Frodo  so guess who's stuck with Samwise Gamgee 
label2 You make a lot of sense  I like this table  and I'm getting it 
label2 That one ? Damn right I like that one 
label2 Hey  all set  What do you think ? There's plenty of room for everybody  a view out the window 
label2 We're not 
label2 She's right  a committee that important should meet more often 
label2 Oh  This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life ?
label2 Fancy sounds like a compliment 
label2 Mm  Sheldon  you didn't have a personality  you just had some shows you liked 
label2 Or you're just a tall  annoying frog 
label2 Well  we should call her 
label2 But the mission wouldn't be for at least a year  Isn't that enough time to get your blood pressure under '
label2 So why are you trying to ruin it ?
label2 Oh  don't anthropomorphize him  he's got big eyes  but his feelings are not like ours 
label2 Well  it's not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big  evil baby 
label2 But Penny  this was your idea  You said that I should stand up to him 
label2 Why would you do that ?
label2 So are you really not gonna do this movie ?
label2 Well  but don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies ?
label2 I don't know anything about show business  so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings  I'm sure you know what you're doing 
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 I'm so sorry  I know it's a sensitive subject  but can you reconsider that part in the movie ?
label2 At least they talked about you on Letterman  Come on  I can drive you wherever you need to go 
label2 You sure you want to do this ?
label2 Let's get this over with  Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory  or are we having sex ? I'm just  I'm trying to lighten the mood 
label2 So humiliating ? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory ' ? I'm sorry  I'll  I'll stop  I'll stop 
label2 I know  I thought we'd take yours 
label2 I mean  you could say thank you  I did just buy you a car 
label2 Yeah  he has a very sensitive butt  Well  it's true  Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up 
label2 What do you guys want to do tonight ?
label2 Oh  my God  Stuart ?
label2 Calling 911 
label2 What do you mean it's too late ?
label2 Oh  come on 
label2 Come on  guys  Raj put a lot of effort into this  And that's great  It's not sad  it's great 
label2 Oh  no  no  That's Clarence Darrow  It's from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers  You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system 
label2 I've seen old pictures of you  You were never a fat kid 
label2 So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart ?
label2 Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he's just ripping off Terminator ?
label2 Oh  does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison  it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand  but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier ?
label2 Uh  uh  uh  hang on  Do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful ?
label2 But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor  I might not have that much choice in where I end up 
label2 Well  you don't go into science for the money 
label2 In a minute  I don't understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science 
label2 It was  By Terminator 
label2 Of course  Well  hey  how about this ? Whether we're friends  not friends  scattered around the world  no matter what  let's all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8: 00 p  m  and have dinner like we always do 
label2 All right  I'll see you guys in 20 years 
label2 If only there were a solution to that 
label2 So go to the bathroom 
label2 Why not ?
label2 Forgive me for asking a stupid question  but why are you being stupid ?
label2 Why did I pee before I decided to move in here ?
label2 Hey  Oh  how'd the audition go ?
label2 Oh  that's great 
label2 Aren't you gonna ask ?
label2 Well  for starters  I wouldn't eat the bananas 
label2 Uh  uh  does it at least pay well ?
label2 Just to clarify  which one of you is wearing the bikini ?
label2 So it's a family film 
label2 So  are you gonna see her again ?
label2 You have my blessing  Go for it 
label2 Okay  that's enough 
label2 What's up ?
label2 Was it the two women thing or the playa ? It was the playa 
label2 Aren't you gonna ask me ?
label2 I got to tell you  the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery  the more excited I get 
label2 Oh  I don't know  Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven  the Higgs field just got proven  and you've been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you're no closer to proving it than when you started 
label2 Hey  how's dating two women going ?
label2 Women  Who knows what'll set ' em off ?
label2 Oh  yeah  Wasn't that the basis of your postdoc fellowship ?
label2 Are you sure you want to do this ?
label2 What about your old look  well-groomed ventriloquist doll ?
label2 That doesn't work any more  He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor  So  now that you're no longer invested in string theory  what are you gonna pursue ?
label2 It actually looks good  Sheldon 
label2 Hey  I've got a good job  I could buy salmon  You don't know 
label2 One of the people that lives in his head 
label2 How you feeling ?
label2 Are you gonna introduce me to your friend ?
label2 I don't know  I heard you reading pretty loud last night 
label2 After she put you to bed  she went home 
label2 It's sweet that he thinks there's a story 
label2 Huh  well  I think there's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter 
label2 Hey  How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays ?
label2 You made fun of us  Said it was stupid 
label2 Great  what do you want to do ?
label2 What can we do that's different ?
label2 Aw  What's wrong with her ?
label2 That's not what I meant 
label2 What ails her ?
label2 Hey  how about that Asian fusion place ?
label2 He'd probably give you homework 
label2 Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty  What ? I don't lie to her 
label2 You and I never just hang out like this  Why is that ?
label2 Yeah  We should do it more often 
label2 Oh  doesn't seem like it  She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her 
label2 Well  Penny can be very persuasive  She's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn't normally do 
label2 Yeah  she does 
label2 Really ?
label2 Well  well they've known each other a long time  and Penny grew up around horses  so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish 
label2 Well  it took him a long time to get comfortable around me  too 
label2 Something terrible in a former life ? I don't know 
label2 May the force be with you  Get it ?
label2 Hey  you got a second ?
label2 Sheldon  I've got some bad news 
label2 I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away 
label2 Sorry  buddy 
label2 Comforting you ?
label2 Anyway  the  the funeral's on Sunday 
label2 Yeah  um  of all the things about this that are sad  that might not be number one  You okay ? I know he meant a lot to you 
label2 Okay  Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box 
label2 He was 84  he'd say where's my pudding ?
label2 Really ?
label2 Yeah  we won't be eating Arthur tonight 
label2 Oh that's  that's fine  Go ahead 
label2 I am not a crybaby 
label2 The toys were holding hands in a furnace  Look  Arthur lived a full life  And he inspired a lot of people  Sure  he  he was my childhood hero  but the fact that I got to work with him  side by side  before he died was  it was  it was a gift 
label2 I got your back 
label2 So  what did you think of your first funeral ?
label2 Yeah  well  when I die  you can rent a bounce house 
label2 Mm  Well  I think more about if I'd have any regrets 
label2 Mm  you know  that I didn't travel more  take more risks  learn another language 
label2 That's true 
label2 I just thought of one more 
label2 I was not gonna propose  It's already two to one 
label2 I proposed twice  you proposed once  Two to one 
label2 I don't know what you're upset about  I'm the one who's losing 
label2 Yeah  I think I would 
label2 It's just such a big decision  I don't want to have any regrets 
label2 Ooh  interesting  Did you just propose to me again ?
label2 Really ? Because I just heard will you marry me ? That's two proposals  one day  Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter 
label2 Now  about that second proposal  On the one hand '
label2 Hey  buddy  Heard you're having a rough day  You all right ?
label2 Sheldon  that  that'll take us all night 
label2 At least they toned him down in the second one 
label2 Poor Mrs  Wolowitz 
label2 Hey  how were things on the set ?
label2 It only gets funnier when you explain it  Sheldon 
label2 Whoa  whoa  hang on  There's no need to insult her 
label2 I'm her boyfriend 
label2 A little  yeah 
label2 You having second thoughts about acting ?
label2 Yeah  but it's not always that bad 
label2 What about when you did  uh  Anne Frank at that cute little theater ?
label2 Yeah  but there was ample parking 
label2 And you were so good in the TV commercial 
label2 And I got itchy and swollen just watching you 
label2 Can I get you anything ?
label2 Like what ?
label2 Come on  be serious 
label2 Why ? Because I'm a  a smart decision ?
label2 No  it's exactly what you're saying  I'm the boring thing you're choosing because I'm good for you 
label2 Well  it matters a lot  I don't want to be a bran muffin  I  I want to be a Cinnabon  you know ? A strawberry Pop-Tart  Something you're excited about even though it could give you diabetes 
label2 Oh  Then I guess I'm in 
label2 Not like  I guess I'm in  Like I guess  I'm in !
label2 So is that it ? Are  are we engaged ?
label2 All right 
label2 I'm not sure  Just feels a little anticlimactic 
label2 Oh  I know  This might help 
label2 I've had it for a couple years  not important  Penny  will you marry me ?
label2 This would have been so much more romantic if you didn't have monkey hair on your finger 
label2 How's your mom holding up ?
label2 Hey  hey  what the hell ?
label2 Hey  buddy 
label2 You okay ?
label2 That's a rude thing to say  out loud 
label2 Whatever you do  just don't make any rash decisions 
label2 Hi  Mom  I have some exciting news 
label2 Before I tell you  will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself ?
label2 I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me 
label2 You know what ? It's probably fine 
label2 I'm your son  What about the fact that she's good enough for me ?
label2 Thanks  Mom 
label2 Yes  it would 
label2 What you working on ?
label2 It's nice that you called them esteemed 
label2 So  listen  there was something I was hoping to float past you 
label2 I'm not 
label2 Actually  this is about where she and I are going to live 
label2 That's very sweet  But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with ' not you 
label2 Look  I  I know this is  this is change  and that sounds scary 
label2 I don't know  We just started to think about this  Maybe I'll move in with Penny  or maybe she and I'll take this place  and you can move across the hall 
label2 No  I did not 
label2 Well  you cook for me all the time and  ugh 
label2 It's hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do 
label2 I know you'll try  So  should we talk about setting a date ?
label2 Okay  And when would that be ?
label2 No  I thought he was with you 
label2 What happened ?
label2 Well  he's been having a couple of tough days  I'm sure he's fine  He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress 
label2 Anyway  as I was saying  Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time  ' Cause that's important  Not just for him  but for most anybody  really 
label2 I'm gonna see where he is 
label2 Oh  I know his password  so I can track his phone 
label2 That's weird 
label2 He's at the train station 
label2 It's dark out and he's alone  I don't like it  Let's go get him 
label2 It's not just that  My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him 
label2 Seriously ? You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush 
label2 Okay  I know you're upset and there's a lot of stuff going on  but it's nothing we can't work out  Come on  let's get you home 
label2 So a few things don't go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo ?
label2 Then what can I do ?
label2 What ? Why ?
label2 You know he can't take a trip like this by himself 
label2 No  he looks like a grown man  You've seen Freaky Friday  sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies 
label2 I know  but '
label2 Sheldon  if you really need to do this  I'm not gonna stand in your way 
label2 Okay  Good luck 
label2 I'm gonna miss you 
label2 He just made that easier 
label2 He's okay ?
label2 Morning 
label2 Um  let me just have some coffee first  and then I'll have the strength to tell you how much I won't be doing that 
label2 Hey  buddy  Good to hear your voice 
label2 I'd love to  I'm just about to do yoga with Penny 
label2 Oh  my God  are you okay ?
label2 Okay  Uh  I'll  I'll come get you  What's the address ?
label2 He got all of his stuff stolen 
label2 Sheldon  hang tight  Hey  do you want me to bring anything ?
label2 Yeah  he's fine  he's just a little rattled 
label2 Oh  right 
label2 Come on  you didn't even try 
label2 Thanks again for coming  Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself 
label2 How were they ?
label2 Hang on  You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station ?
label2 I don't care 
label2 What's the big deal ?
label2 Well  yeah  it's true  You  you are a god to me 
label2 Just tell her 
label2 Yeah  If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country  do you know what they would have said ?
label2 Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona 
label2 And you thought they all had a silver lining 
label2 Mm  I don't know  Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher's pet ?
label2 Hey  how'd it go with human resources ?
label2 The kids are gonna love him 
label2 This might not be that bad  Uh  you like telling people they're wrong 
label2 Look  most importantly  this will let you move on and study dark matter 
label2 Hey  We just wanted to see how your class was going  Where is everybody ?
label2 Well  that's not your fault 
label2 Yeah  why would you do that ?
label2 Hmm  You're up late 
label2 Sheldon  why are you doing this ?
label2 Might be something to think about 
label2 Sheldon  I promise  Your uvula does not have an STD 
label2 Come on  give him a hard one 
label2 Okay  next question  for the Butterfinger  How long is a galactic yea
label2 We are so smart 
label2 Right again 
label2 Yeah  just nice and easy  right over the plate 
label2 Now you know why we're not outside 
label2 Oh  that poor waiter 
label2 You don't even like Yorkshire pudding 
label2 Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive 
label2 You don't honestly think that  do you ?
label2 There isn't any ranking  And if there were  we wouldn't be at the bottom of it 
label2 Okay  I got to  I  I  I  I got to ask  What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn't ?
label2 Yeah  toddlers do that 
label2 Whatever  You can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement 
label2 I'm not jealous  I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships like they're something that can be quantified 
label2 How ridiculous is he ?
label2 Sheldon  you're just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion 
label2 So  this is accurate ?
label2 Fine  We'll take it right now 
label2 Come on  It'll be fun 
label2 Are you mad at me ?
label2 Um  whew ? Is this about the test  or is this about us ?
label2 Yeah  that scares me  too 
label2 Sometimes 
label2 Okay  well  this might make you feel better  Uh  we're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster  and so  that's something that we have in common  Also  we both think I'm not funny  Huh ? See  you're not laughing 
label2 I killed his Chewbacca slippers 
label2 No  no  no  I don't want to 
label2 Because it doesn't matter  I don't care if we're a ten or a two 
label2 Marriage is scary  You're scared  I'm scared  But it doesn't make me not want to do it  It  it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you 
label2 This is fun  huh ? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch  have a hot dog  watch the game 
label2 Have you guys heard about this research team that's trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur ?
label2 Yeah  I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend 
label2 Yeah  you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy  Yeah  well  no  this study refers to romantic partners  Not the way I would categorize the two of us 
label2 I've seen him do it  It's not romantic 
label2 What happens if she doesn't like us ?
label2 Nice to finally meet you  too 
label2 Wow  Raj  you were not lying about her 
label2 Okay  him I believe because he's an 80 - year-old man in a 15 - year-old's tee shirt  But you're just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs 
label2 Hey  here's a thought  Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs ?
label2 It's kind of a dream come true 
label2 It's not that bad 
label2 Oh  kids buy comic books  It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store 
label2 Hold on  So  your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up ?
label2 And are you gonna use candy to lure them in ?
label2 Why say it ?
label2 Uh  do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list ?
label2 Will you stay out of this ?
label2 That's true 
label2 There's something I wanted to run past you 
label2 Mm  the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store  Is that okay ?
label2 Well  you know  we're engaged  and it's kind of a big deal financially  It seems like something we should talk about 
label2 I know  I was looking forward to it 
label2 That's not what happened 
label2 Well  maybe we have lost our focus 
label2 Fine  Then we'll just stay here and do it 
label2 Hey  So  the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend  I just wanted to know if that's okay  You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday 
label2 They seem okay with it 
label2 Okay  let's focus  The girls are gone  we have 48 hours  There are no distractions  Let's change the world 
label2 Guys  in 30 seconds  we went from let's change the world to let's watch TV 
label2 I  I think I still have it 
label2 Ah  here it is  Whoa  I haven't looked at these in years  Robot girlfriend 
label2 Robot prostitute 
label2 Okay  let's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with  All right  no  here we go  ergonomic heated seat cushion 
label2 You know  let's just come up with something new 
label2 How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality ?
label2 Well  it's  it's possible at absolute zero  but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions 
label2 Had will have placed ?
label2 Okay  so  it wasn't until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions  That's when he altered the timeline 
label2 Wait  Is brought right ?
label2 I don't know  You did it to me 
label2 Guys  what are we doing ? We sent the girls away so we could focus 
label2 All right 
label2 So  I've been thinking about the hover boards  and maybe there's a way we could use Maglev technology 
label2 If only we had one 
label2 Okay  so we agree  whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off 
label2 All right  now  one benefit of quantum coupling '
label2 I think it'll be pretty clear  If not  we'll take a vote  Oh  and also '
label2 We didn't have to  that was clearly a tangent  Now come on  Back to work  If we're leaning towards quantum coupling ' Aah ! Why ?
label2 Thank you  And now I owe you one 
label2 Everyone stop  This was a stupid idea  Negative reinforcement isn't working 
label2 Look  We keep procrastinating  We saw Back to the Future II  pigeons playing ping-pong  a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark 
label2 It's late  We've wasted hours  Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight ?
label2 So you're  you're saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop ?
label2 It really does hold up 
label2 She doesn't flirt with doctors 
label2 Yeah  I've read about that  they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines 
label2 Yeah  it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost 
label2 So  one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus  and it was only for PlayStation 2  but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics  I finally got the chance to play it  and for some reason  it just wasn't as good as the first one  Or something about yoga 
label2 Well  I was just saying that there was this video game '
label2 Huh  What is this ?
label2 The one I gave you ?
label2 Uh  yeah 
label2 Nothing 
label2 You're right 
label2 Aw  oh  thank you  That is so sweet 
label2 You know what  you don't have to give me this  You keep it 
label2 The car was a gift  it was something you needed  I was happy to help you out 
label2 Well  this is silly  so you don't need the car  but you could use it to buy yourself something else  like a new purse to put all this money in 
label2 I know  and I'm proud of you  but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice  Like this 
label2 I don't  either 
label2 Sure  In my mind  that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex 
label2 No  no  no  no  hear me out  I know things got a little weird last night 
label2 Well  I think I came up with a pretty good solution 
label2 Why don't we just put the money in a joint account ? It'll be our first money together  We can use it for the wedding  the honeymoon  whatever 
label2 Yeah  of course you do  I'm not just a genius in bed  You sure are  baby 
label2 I want you to know I get why you don't want the money  you've got this new job  you're excited about being financially independent  and I am nothing but proud of you 
label2 Hmm  Maybe  Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues 
label2 Well  I can't believe you'd say that  You know how insecure I am about my insecurities 
label2 Thanks again for having us 
label2 Well  nailed it 
label2 Like I would swing with him 
label2 She made him a chore chart 
label2 Not a problem  I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life  so really  it's what I think love looks like 
label2 Yeah I don't want something dumb like money to come between us 
label2 Should we go ?
label2 I've never done it on a big old pile of cash before  Me neither  Leonard  It's my first time  too 
label2 Great timing  food just got here 
label2 What ? Why didn't you say that first ?
label2 I think so 
label2 Excuse me ?
label2 Thank you  Sorry 
label2 He tried to score with Penny 
label2 Oh  Well  you know  just being myself  really 
label2 I don't know that I'd call myself an infection 
label2 Can we please change the subject ?
label2 Ah  that's a good question  Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring  causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available 
label2 Can we talk in private ?
label2 So  uh  what's the deal ? You take off your ring when you go to work ?
label2 Oh  he was upset  So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage 
label2 No  I got upset  And Sheldon made me a beverage  too 
label2 A little  but he's basically harmless  He's actually kind of a nice guy 
label2 All right  I'll get rid of him  But you owe me one 
label2 Yeah  sure  You owe me 
label2 Wow  Donkey Kong  This  this was my game when I was a kid 
label2 No  because I liked it 
label2 I wonder where Dr  Lorvis is  He's been gone a while 
label2 Uh  guys  we're locked in here 
label2 Oh-hom yeah 
label2 Better than okay  I am having the game of my life 
label2 Got it 
label2 Just hang on 
label2 Oh  hey  oh  we ran into your mom at Benihana last night 
label2 Don't rule out the dating 
label2 Let me guess  you think the whole idea is lame ?
label2 Hmm  to be honest  it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you 
label2 You know  if you're not gonna learn how to do this  they make some pretty good clip-ons 
label2 Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him 
label2 There  perfect 
label2 I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien 
label2 If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket  you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel  So  anything else planned for tonight ?
label2 And while you're at it  I know that at this age your hormones are raging  but just because all your friends are having sex doesn't mean you have to 
label2 You know  ' cause  ' cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night 
label2 Wow  you look amazing 
label2 Oh  it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades  Try not to touch it when you're dancing 
label2 He's right  I was thinking of the lower flermin 
label2 Oh  the girls really did a nice job 
label2 What makes you think I didn't go to my prom ? I went 
label2 Oh  it's all right  We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation  so '
label2 No  you wouldn't have 
label2 It was before my growth spurt 
label2 Very funny 
label2 There's no music 
label2 My God  who's the dork now ? Thank you for wearing your flats 
label2 Oh  not fun  The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses 
label2 Because I can't breathe  I snore  I get sinus infections 
label2 I think you could give a better clue 
label2 Okay  why ?
label2 I told you  there's nothing to worry about 
label2 Buddy  wh  do you realize that that also means 699999 people don't die ?
label2 Hey  What're you working on ?
label2 Great timing  My check sphincter light just went on 
label2 For the same reason I don't wear the apron or the hair net 
label2 I don't have epilepsy  either 
label2 Buddy  I  I get that you're worried about me and I  I appreciate that  but I'm not going to die 
label2 If there was an asteroid strike  wouldn't you die  too ?
label2 Tell you what  the surgery's not for a week  I'll think about it 
label2 The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten 
label2 He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we'd be floating around in  he didn't even question it 
label2 How is it my fault ?
label2 Okay  first of all  the surgery was a success  and secondly  I didn't even want you there 
label2 Sheldon  I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery  but you were worried about nothing 
label2 I never thought I'd say these words  but come on  nose spider 
label2 Oh  what'd you get ?
label2 That's funny  Boy  I'm gonna miss these painkillers 
label2 I don't think he had a family 
label2 I know  You can spend your whole life working  and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box 
label2 Hey  Hey  we're supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it's important 
label2 It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this 
label2 That someone was Sheldon  and the day was yesterday  Hey  look at this  Dear Roger  to be opened upon your first great discovery  Love  Mom  Wow  look at the date  He saved this fifty years and never got to open it 
label2 Look at these notebooks  They're full of pages and pages of data  He clearly spent years on this 
label2 Well  but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him ? What if  what if this is the thing that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne ?
label2 This has to mean something 
label2 Well  maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer 
label2 Oh  we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems 
label2 Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis  do you ?
label2 I think if you're pulling up your pants  you're not a doorman 
label2 Uh  I've been looking for a Professor Sharpe ?
label2 Hi  We're from the university  We're trying to get some information about Professor Abbott 
label2 Any chance you know what it is ?
label2 Really ?
label2 So  was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment ?
label2 I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing 
label2 That's a nice way of looking at it 
label2 You know what ? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement  Let's make a pact  When one of us gets their first big breakthrough  we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott 
label2 Then  of course  rubbing our success in Sheldon's face 
label2 How come you're up so late ?
label2 Mm  I know how you feel  I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career  and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking 
label2 Yeah  What did they say ?
label2 Congratulations 
label2 Sheldon  that wasn't for you 
label2 Why not ?
label2 You know the best part of working in the clean room ? No allergies  Check it out  Oh  that  that  that's a lot of oxygen 
label2 Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles ? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses 
label2 You shut the loading doors  right ?
label2 Do you know what a disaster this is ?
label2 What do we do ? Should we call someone ?
label2 It's not a moth 
label2 Okay  so if I remain calm  I'll get more gems like turn off the lights ?
label2 Sure  If the pigeon's stoned or a trucker 
label2 I told you my plan  Let's call Building Services and get help 
label2 No  admit that you contaminated the clean room 
label2 What about when you flipped the Mars Rover  or lost Koothrappali's dog  or almost drove off with that baby ?
label2 Fine  put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag 
label2 Oh  Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim 
label2 And you found somebody you could push around ?
label2 No  no  no  No  Raj  go ahead  say what you were gonna say 
label2 Okay  On the count of three  I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne  Howard  you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit  Raj  you hold open the curtain so he can fly out 
label2 Do you want the fire extinguisher ?
label2 Great  Here you go 
label2 You miss the blanket now  don't you ?
label2 Relax  it wasn't your fault 
label2 Uh  guys  I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds 
label2 I'm not doing it  You killed him  you do it 
label2 Anything ?
label2 Wait  wait  his wing moved 
label2 No  we're both to blame  You know  let me take the heat on this one 
label2 I don't know  There's still a bird in here  We are gonna get in a ton of trouble 
label2 No  our names are on the sign-in sheet 
label2 She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave 
label2 I thought you hate giving gifts 
label2 Blue and yellow make green 
label2 No  no  no  come on  don't leave  Just try it 
label2 You know  they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we're into 
label2 You got it  you girls are in charge 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Hang on  why do we have to hate it ?
label2 I did not force you to go to that 
label2 I wasn't gonna get beat up 
label2 Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable ?
label2 Ah  interesting  we're being accused of making you do things you don't like  and here you are  doing the same thing to poor Amy 
label2 That's what I was doing 
label2 Well  yeah 
label2 Uh  I've got some bad news  There's no cell service in here 
label2 That's true 
label2 Sheldon  it's fine 
label2 Okay  And to defend  I roll two sixes  I win 
label2 I don't know  but the girls do a lot for us  It's the least we can do 
label2 Look at you  being all mature 
label2 I  I'm sorry ? You make compromises for me ?
label2 On Earth ? In our lives ? That  that  that we're living ?
label2 That is not a compromise  A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how 
label2 What ? Then  then why don't you do it ?
label2 Because of you  I'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home  I'm not allowed to whistle  I don't wear shoes that might squeak 
label2 Sheldon  do you realize I don't live with the woman I love because of you ? No other reason  Just you 
label2 Yes  it's true  The last time I brought it up  you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away 
label2 Sheldon  I  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings  I've been holding a lot of this in for a while 
label2 Do you mean that ?
label2 Come on  don't get upset 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 I'm not leaving your world  I'm just talking about living across the hall 
label2 Everything's fine  We just started talking about living arrangements 
label2 You got it 
label2 Yeah  I'm proud of him  too 
label2 Okay  we're headed out  see you later 
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 Hello  can you hear me ? Sheldon  I haven't changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years 
label2 Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph 
label2 Ooh  and one time when you were asleep  Amy totally took off her ' and that's why you're the best roommate ever 
label2 I don't want to talk about it  There  the place is all yours 
label2 Hey  we're home  Any progress ?
label2 Call me if you need anything 
label2 Cinnamon  Give me another one 
label2 We all got the Christmas card  Cinnamon 
label2 Ooh  Emily  I heard him say that to Emily  Hey  I thought you were staying home 
label2 That is a tough one  Uh  I know he brushes both of them 
label2 So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say ?
label2 Because it is what you want  and it's not what you said 
label2 What is going on ?
label2 That can't be much fun for Amy  You know  at work today  he tried his first Red Bull 
label2 He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car 
label2 You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment 
label2 Maybe in the morning 
label2 You know  he can be a lot of trouble  but when I see him lying here asleep like this  I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face 
label2 I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out  so my levels  right up there 
label2 Well  it's tricky working with superfluids  Whatever container you put them in  they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own 
label2 Exactly  except you don't have a lunatic running around  yelling  I fed you sugar water  why are you biting me ? Come on  this is boring  you really want to talk about this ?
label2 Okay  well  this is cool  Uh  there's a thing called superfluid vacuum theory  where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities  viscosity  density  surface tension '
label2 No  no  People don't talk about surface tension  If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble ' This is exciting  This is really exciting  I have to go find Sheldon 
label2 Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time  So what do you think ? What do you think ? So what do you think ?
label2 What ? Is it wrong ? Have you seen it somewhere else ?
label2 I know this isn't my area  and I could never do the math like you can  but could this be something ?
label2 Really ?
label2 You do ? You're not messing with me ?
label2 You're giving me a sticker ?
label2 I'm not a preschooler 
label2 You're still awake ?
label2 You worked out all the math 
label2 You wrote a paper on my idea ?
label2 When did my idea become our idea ?
label2 This is good  Our idea is really good 
label2 Wow  it's all happening so fast  Should we just sleep on it ?
label2 You're sure it's good ?
label2 One  two three 
label2 Sheldon  this is superfluid helium  Put this in your mouth  your tongue will freeze and break off 
label2 Really ? What'd they say ?
label2 Oh  the pleasure is mine  Mr  Innovative  Uh  another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking  Do you hear that  Mr  Out-Of-The ?
label2 Okay  okay  Uh  the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false  I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish 
label2 Sheldon  my name's on that paper  too  There's no upside to doing this 
label2 Upon review  I've changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid  In fact  it's inspired me to come up with my own theory  Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket  much like Cooper and Hofstadter 
label2 Somebody else do it 
label2 Read it back one more time 
label2 And you don't think that's too rough ?
label2 Me-wow 
label2 What did you write ?
label2 What does that mean ?
label2 Are you crazy ? You don't know who this person is  Delete that 
label2 Oh  really ?
label2 Never noticed that about you 
label2 All right  do it  Call him  Let's find out what this loser's ever accomplished 
label2 You really didn't like our paper ?
label2 Stephen Hawking liked our paper  Said the premise is intriguing 
label2 You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said 
label2 Are you kidding ? No  no 
label2 Yeah  okay  I'm good 
label2 No problem 
label2 The place really looks great 
label2 We know  we know  because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime 
label2 Mmm  when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation 
label2 Hi  we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center 
label2 We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay 
label2 That would be great 
label2 He was a jerk because you rear-ended him 
label2 Come on  Sorry to bother you 
label2 Thank you 
label2 That would be great 
label2 That's it  that's the line 
label2 What do you think ?
label2 I can't believe they did that 
label2 Wait  Sheldon gave me a banana in a box  He was testing me  too 
label2 And how could a chimp even solve that ? That was impossible 
label2 So you guys were testing us both ? What is the matter with you ?
label2 Hey  you okay ?
label2 What's wrong ?
label2 I'm so sorry 
label2 How are you doing  Stuart ?
label2 If you want  I can yell at you later 
label2 Let's have a toast  To Mrs  Wolowitz  A loving mother to all of us  We'll miss you 
label2 That doesn't sound right  My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging 
label2 I'm telling you  you can't create love in a few hours  Right ?
label2 I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things for ten years  Tag  you're it 
label2 I'm in love  Let's do something else 
label2 What's that ?
label2 Ladies ?
label2 This is cool 
label2 Which book are we looking for ?
label2 Here it is  There's a black light 
label2 I bet the key's behind it 
label2 We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun ?
label2 I was unstoppable  I mean  I was  I was on fire  It was like my mind and my body were totally connected  like  like athletes must feel when they're in the zone 
label2 Why not ?
label2 Well  congratulations  Who would've thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family ?
label2 Hey  hey  Listen  I  I have a little confession to make 
label2 Well  ' cause I got it at the dirty store 
label2 In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away 
label2 Okay  uh  well  I hope it's fun  I mean  it  it comes with paints  and  and it's kind of creative and artistic 
label2 No  no  We cover ourselves in body paint  and then  then we get on this big canvas and do our thing 
label2 Really ?
label2 Okay  but it's a drive  the one I went to is in San Diego 
label2 I thought it'd be a little more  just more 
label2 Maybe along the z-axis  but x and y are looking pretty sad 
label2 Damn straight  almost 1am  And we weren't even watching TV  We were watching Netflix  like the kids do 
label2 Yeah  You get the paint  I'll rest for 30 to 40 minutes  and then we do this 
label2 Right there  right there  Oh  God  that's it 
label2 Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles 
label2 Well  we did it 
label2 I mean  I was on fire  I  I was in the zone  like an athlete 
label2 So  where do we want to hang it ?
label2 Seems a shame to throw it away 
label2 God  I love you  I love you so much 
label2 Actually  your name is on the electric bill 
label2 I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 Did they hate it ?
label2 So what's the problem ?
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Really ?
label2 Cooper and his team ?
label2 That's not helping 
label2 It's kind of a big deal 
label2 Can we please just stop talking about it ?
label2 Nothing  I'm fine 
label2 What are we doing ?
label2 Does it have a camera in it ?
label2 Baby's listening 
label2 What happened ? Did you tell him it was my idea ?
label2 Why did he think you're the lead scientist ? It was my idea 
label2 I'm the one who thought of it 
label2 Yeah  But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything 
label2 He always needs all the attention  He's such a baby 
label2 I swear  he is never ever playing with my helicopter 
label2 Of course 
label2 So  Stuart  have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house ?
label2 Subtle 
label2 Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration  Uh  new salon topic  What's more important  an idea or its execution ?
label2 No  it's okay  We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion  At least I am  Howard  what do you think ?
label2 Oh  now he's a genius ? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering 
label2 You're being ridiculous 
label2 Lots of people also didn't have that idea  like everyone in the entire world except for me 
label2 Right now  I'm just trying to burp without throwing up 
label2 Oh  I like to laugh  But say it anyway 
label2 Public restroom kit  Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places 
label2 If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall  I'm in 
label2 That soy Frappuccino I had 
label2 We haven't been on a road trip in a while  This is fun 
label2 No  listen  we wrote a paper together  Now we get to go to a university and talk about it ? That's pretty cool 
label2 What ? This road trip just got crazy 
label2 I'm surprised you know that reference 
label2 It could be 
label2 Exactly 
label2 I doubt it 
label2 If we do  we'll just tell him to hit the bricks  see ?
label2 I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in 
label2 We do have time  I mean  we could drive by and just look at it 
label2 I'm about to lose control  and I think I like it 
label2 Wasn't even that hard to find 
label2 I know  You want to get a picture ?
label2 Well  so do I  but they'll never let us 
label2 No  but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me 
label2 Okay  yeah  What do we have to lose ? I'm a little nervous 
label2 Um  uh  uh  uh  we don't have an appointment  and  and we don't belong here  but we  we're  like  crazy-big fans  I mean uh  buh  buh  crazy for Star Wars crazy  not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape  although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in 
label2 And that's how it's done 
label2 We're trying to get past a security guard  not rescue Zelda 
label2 Uh  I'm just gonna be honest with the guy 
label2 Well  what's your plan ?
label2 Uh  I'm just gonna tell you the truth 
label2 We don't have an appointment  We  we're just fans of Mr  Lucas's work  and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around 
label2 I'm sorry  don't listen to him  We're actually physicists  We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today  We just  we had some time to kill 
label2 Thank you so much  See ? Maybe honesty is the best ' What are you doing ?
label2 I don't know  Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star 
label2 Oh  shut up 
label2 Uh-huh  I'm normally very nice  but you shut up  too 
label2 The glass is empty  Sheldon  It's completely empty  If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst  he would be dead  do you know why ?
label2 Fine  then tell me how I should be looking at it 
label2 That part was pretty good 
label2 You did flop around a lot 
label2 I know 
label2 I guess this could count as an adventure 
label2 Oh  Sheldon  I'm sure it's not because they don't think you're an elite scientist 
label2 Look  you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this 
label2 I was gonna say or  but why bother ?
label2 Well  you picked a good one to start  Wil's had lots of great guests  Jonathan Frakes  Brent Spiner  Michael Dorn  Gates McFadden 
label2 This is exciting 
label2 Oh  if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana  that was just my friends  Howard and Raj 
label2 I don't think you can do both 
label2 Give me back that juice 
label2 Well  what if you get it ?
label2 From a Kevin Smith movie ?
label2 I'm just trying to protect you  How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress ?
label2 I went to school for half my life  I have a doctorate  I'm still paying off college loans 
label2 Wil  can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit ?
label2 Hang on  if you're making all this money  where is it ?
label2 What does that mean  under your bed ?
label2 Wait a minute  you have a guy ?
label2 Why would I have a guy ? I don't have any money 
label2 Great  you're not only more successful than me  now you're more mature 
label2 That would be great  thank you 
label2 Yes  it is  Wil 
label2 Hello ? What is this ?
label2 Are those my sheets ?
label2 Okay  Well  you kids have fun  I'm gonna go to sleep 
label2 Yeah  I'm good 
label2 Okay  fine  Sheldon  may I please visit your fort ?
label2 Thank you 
label2 Really ?
label2 Uh  okay  okay  Uh  we  we get it 
label2 That's pretty cool  Sheldon 
label2 Oh  When I encountered alien life  I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot 
label2 Congratulations 
label2 My mommy raised a gentleman 
label2 Yeah  I'm excited to help 
label2 I get it  Uh  just this morning  Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict 
label2 Yeah  That's better than what I did say  which was  fine  I'll eat them with club soda 
label2 Mmm  they're alpha males 
label2 Or we could be omegas  They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas 
label2 I don't know  Should we call Sheldon and Howard ?
label2 Well  aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player 
label2 That would be more helpful if E  T  were real 
label2 My God  when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him 
label2 They zip him up in that bag 
label2 The flower dies 
label2 All right  so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple 
label2 Yeah  Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different 
label2 The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch 
label2 I know 
label2 Great  Now that we're all on the same page  let's get together tonight and work on it 
label2 How is that building on what he just said ?
label2 Building on that  I'd like to remind you  I'm lactose intolerant 
label2 Okay  since we agree on the delivery system for the message  maybe we should talk about what the message could be 
label2 Squeeze yourself 
label2 Wait a minute  Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us 
label2 Sheldon  you're not in charge  Raj is in charge 
label2 Okay  we should leave in about an hour  You all packed ?
label2 I'll take my chances 
label2 Mm  I thought it'd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds  I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me 
label2 Why did you need a belt ?
label2 It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives 
label2 No  it's like that  Well  I'm excited to show you around 
label2 Yes  We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press  but I'm not doing that either 
label2 I don't think so 
label2 I guess not 
label2 Yeah  I worked hard on that speech  too 
label2 Oh  thank you  but I'm okay 
label2 Greetings  distinguished cheerleaders 
label2 Hey  where'd you go ?
label2 Really ? Sex last night  pancakes this morning  am I dying ?
label2 A cap and gown ? Why do I need a cap and gown ?
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 Really ? That's amazing  And you gave me the robes to give it in  Thank you 
label2 Short and sexy  that's my wheelhouse 
label2 I don't think this is gonna work 
label2 A  surprised you know that  B  I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Well  I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case  But I have to say  this is very freeing 
label2 Oh  Done and done 
label2 They're graduating 
label2 My point is  while you're spending all this time on your own  building computers or practicing your cello  what you're really doing is becoming interesting  And when people finally do notice you  they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought  And for those of you who were popular in high school  it's over  sorry  Thank you and congratulations 
label2 So you really think they liked it ?
label2 I don't know  some time tomorrow morning 
label2 No need to  As soon as she flies into California airspace  I'll feel a disturbance in the Force 
label2 If you could run out and get a PhD  that might make her like you 
label2 Uh  I don't know  They're pretty different 
label2 Yes  Mother 
label2 I change my answer  It  it's amazing  It's hot  We can barely keep our hands off each other 
label2 See  this right here  what you're doing  can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom ?
label2 Of course not  She's  she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady  and you have to be respectful of her beliefs 
label2 Thank you 
label2 East Texas 
label2 Hey  look who's here 
label2 We just spent two hours in traffic  Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper ?
label2 That's so sweet  you think I have self-esteem 
label2 Subtle  mom  real subtle 
label2 You mean  my hypothesis  I hypothesized it all by myself 
label2 You still are  Uh  Mom  hey  tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner 
label2 So  Mom  you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged 
label2 We did not  That's not true  Can I speak to you alone for a second ?
label2 It came from Tiffany's 
label2 Keep walking 
label2 Yes  and we'll get back to that  But  uh  even with your mother here  you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom  You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers 
label2 Yes  you are a super weaner 
label2 Yeah  you're right  That is the term I'm looking for  You are a dirty double mother suckler 
label2 Oh  don't flatter yourself  She likes everybody better than she likes me 
label2 Thank you 
label2 That's not what it is 
label2 Oh  me 
label2 I don't really feel I deserve it 
label2 Okay  Mom  let's get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else 
label2 Oh  really ? That's too bad 
label2 Wow  When does that start ?
label2 Oh  my mother 
label2 I get it  Smallville almost wrecked you 
label2 Yeah  I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of ' em 
label2 We're gonna set a date 
label2 Really good 
label2 And we've been busy with our paper 
label2 So  why haven't we picked a date ?
label2 You still want to get married  right ?
label2 I don't know  Because we don't have a date ?
label2 Is your dad paying for it ?
label2 Okay  two friends each 
label2 Fine  I want black-tie 
label2 Okay  Well  then it's settled  Small indoor church wedding  black-tie  no butterflies 
label2 Sheldon  I'm not a whiner 
label2 Look  all she's saying is we are in love so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now 
label2 Yeah  but we'll be old and gross together 
label2 I'm in  Let's do it 
label2 Thanks 
label2 Doesn't sound very romantic 
label2 I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel 
label2 I know  You think people are gonna be mad ?
label2 It is  It is about us 
label2 Right  No surprises 
label2 Uh  well  there  there's one thing I feel I should tell you 
label2 You know  so we can go into this with no secrets between us 
label2 Okay  um  well  there was this girl 
label2 Nothing really  It was just kissing 
label2 Did you ever do anything like this since we've been ?
label2 Well  like I said  we're about to get married  and I  I want a clean slate  No secrets 
label2 Would you rather I didn't tell you ?
label2 See  now I'm confused  I mean  what  what am I supposed to do ?
label2 I can do that  Uh  uh  from now on  this mouth  you and food  that's it 
label2 It wasn't even very good  She was a smoker  I'd just been seasick 
label2 So  we're still getting married ?
label2 Because we love each other 
label2 ' Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don't believe they can land a short  nearsighted scientist  Let's give them hope 
label2 If you're not into this  we can do it another time 
label2 Aw  That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together 
label2 No  Why ?
label2 Why not ?
label2 What happened now ?
label2 Oh  no  Seriously ?
label2 Buddy  I'm so sorry  Is there anything I can do ?
label2 Sheldon  uh  okay  just because you're going through this with Amy doesn't mean that all women are bad 
label2 Penny's on the phone with her 
label2 No  I think it's because we're eloping 
label2 I don't think the strippers prepare the meal  but okay  Look  it's not how I pictured it either  but I'm still glad we're doing it 
label2 You sure ?
label2 You're right  I'm sorry  We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it  So what do you think ? Should we run next door and grab a bite ?
label2 Oh  the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals 
label2 You know what ? It's fine 
label2 This is it 
label2 I love you 
label2 We're good 
label2 Penny  we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began  I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us  so that we could be together and make each other whole 
label2 Yeah  I'm so glad you guys could watch 
label2 Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV ?
label2 Thank you  Finally  there's a Mrs  Hofstadter who isn't disappointed in me 
label2 Just tell me 
label2 Oh  no  No  come on  I have a friend in you  You said so 
label2 No  she had dental insurance 
label2 Yes  I felt guilty as soon as it happened  I feel guilty every time I see her 
label2 What do I mean ? Boy  that's a toughie 
label2 No  of course not  Okay  look  instead of fighting  why don't we dim the lights  um  get naked and make a baby ? I was trying to lighten the mood  It's not easy  You try it 
label2 I asked you over and over if you were okay  Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't ?
label2 Okay  listen  I may not have been entirely faithful  but you  you are not easy to lift 
label2 Sure  let's make it an even hundred 
label2 How am I supposed to sleep ? I've been married less than 24 hours  and my wife isn't speaking to me 
label2 Of course not 
label2 What are we gonna do ?
label2 Please  tell me how I can fix it 
label2 Okay  that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard 
label2 Well  trust me  I wish it never happened 
label2 Wait  wait  wait  how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two ?
label2 Oh  we didn't screw around  We just got drunk and made out 
label2 Call you back  Hey 
label2 I would love that 
label2 Hey  uh  buddy  can we have some privacy ?
label2 Wake up  wake up  wake up 
label2 Uh  first of all  you made that guy cry 
label2 Secondly  I can't think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy 
label2 What  you actually want to meet her ?
label2 I'm not being weird  Am I being weird ?
label2 Fine  you want to meet her ?
label2 How many times do I have to tell you ? I have no interest in this woman 
label2 Oh  great  there's Mandy 
label2 That's not helpful 
label2 Are we done ?
label2 I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny  tell her she has nothing to worry about 
label2 Uh  do you mind if I sit ?
label2 So  um  I've been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat 
label2 You know  what we did  when we were drunk 
label2 No  we just made out 
label2 Uh  okay  well  um  I got married recently 
label2 Never gets old  No  no  to a girl  Anyway  I told her what happened between you and me  and she's concerned about us seeing each other at work 
label2 Because I didn't want there to be any secrets between us 
label2 No  I don't think so  Although  Penny did say exactly that 
label2 I mean  she's really beautiful  She could have any guy she wants  Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me 
label2 Too expensive  You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love  I mean  my mother did  I mean  no matter how hard I tried  she just didn't have any interest in me 
label2 I wonder if that's why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon  I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby  but the baby had Sheldon's head on it 
label2 Okay  yeah  um  do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding ?
label2 Penny  after all these years  I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you 
label2 You do ?
label2 I don't even understand why you're with someone like me  Why would I want to be with someone like me ?
label2 Well  how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together ?
label2 Yeah ? That's because you're beautiful  and your beauty fills my heart with love and song 
label2 Yes  please 
label2 What is this ?
label2 Hey  you're early  The movie doesn't start for an hour 
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 When do we leave ?
label2 So  are you gonna give us a clue where we're headed ?
label2 Your house ?
label2 Fun  I've never been there 
label2 Hey  watch your speed  I hear the Mexican police target tourists 
label2 Sheldon  can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century ? It's like the Batmobile  If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn't cool 
label2 And there's your damsel 
label2 Yeah  this is nothing more than a physics problem 
label2 We're gonna be here foreever 
label2 I don't think the lever's working 
label2 Guys  excuse me  not that calling one of the Avengers isn't a perfectly reasonable choice  but we're scientists  Don't you think we can figure this out using actual science ?
label2 It's a bachelor party  Lighten up 
label2 Well  let's start small  We can always add more 
label2 We got a flat and couldn't get the tyre off 
label2 Thank you 
label2 I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon 
label2 It's just where I need them  You know  she doesn't have a lot of closet space 
label2 Come on  buddy 
label2 Do I really have to do that now ?
label2 That helped 
label2 You're right  But what ? Mexican ? Italian ? German ? Indian ? Greek ? Cuban ? Chinese ? Pizza ? Barbecue ? Korean ? Korean barbecue ?
label2 Oh  thank God 
label2 I guess  I'm just  you know  worried about Sheldon 
label2 I hope so 
label2 No  of course not  I just feel bad 
label2 I know  And it's not like we're abandoning him  Plus  we can FaceTime him whenever we want  you know  once iPhones are invented in his universe 
label2 Hey  we brought you Thai  Where is everything ?
label2 Will you knock it off ? We're across the hall 
label2 Buddy  I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change  but it's not 
label2 That'll teach her to care about your health 
label2 Look at all these activities the university has  Rock climbing club  archery  flag football 
label2 I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q  If that's not a time to bust out the scrabble dance  what's the point of having one ? Hey  Barry Kripke started a fencing club 
label2 It's indoors  so no sunscreen 
label2 No gym shorts that can be yanked down 
label2 Preach 
label2 What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard ?
label2 I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid 
label2 That's not why we're here 
label2 This is easy  I didn't need to wear a cup 
label2 When was your honour insulted ?
label2 Again  that doctor didn't insult your honour  Just checked your prostate 
label2 Well  good  It's nice to see your mind off Amy 
label2 Oh  I hate to say it  but it sounds like he's interested in her 
label2 Of course  She deserves to be happy 
label2 Listen  I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea 
label2 And now the crazy version of what I just said 
label2 Wow  That  that was crazier than I thought 
label2 I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar  Sheldon 
label2 If you're cranky and retaining water  I have a theory 
label2 Maybe you should consider women who aren't in serious relationships with your closest friends ?
label2 You're just sweaty from exercise 
label2 I know it only takes one doctor's finger 
label2 We should let you guys talk 
label2 Look at me go 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 Just tell me 
label2 What are we going to do ?
label2 I'd love to  but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month 
label2 Let's go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve 
label2 Hey  Barry  we're in trouble  We need liquid helium  does the department have any we can use ?
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 We'd have to go to every Party City in California 
label2 How does he get the helium ?
label2 He's got what we need and can meet us tonight 
label2 The man restocking the cereal shelves 
label2 He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch 
label2 Do you want liquid helium or not ?
label2 Then I'm going to tell him we're in 
label2 We're just bending the rules a little  We have grant money to do the experiment  so we're going to spend it on the helium we need  It's not like when Dr  Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys 
label2 Remember ? Don't ask too many questions ?
label2 A little  but if I may quote Einstein  the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man 
label2 Before I answer  may I just say your skin has never looked better 
label2 That must be him 
label2 Uh  I'm Leonard  This is my friend '
label2 Look  you can trust us  We're respected scientists 
label2 My friend does make a decent point about the money  I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front 
label2 No  no  no  Wait  don't go  Just let me explain  We're physicists  and we're trying to prove a hypothesis that we've been working on for over a year 
label2 Okay  but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery  We really need this helium 
label2 Here's the money  Can we do this ?
label2 Will you stop with that already ?
label2 And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that ?
label2 Let's just start the experiment 
label2 We're not getting caught 
label2 The dealer doesn't care  Kripke has no authority over us  and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot  Help me hook this up 
label2 It's probably USC or UCLA 
label2 Thank you for coming back 
label2 No  nothing  We just changed our mind 
label2 Thank you 
label2 You know what ? It's fine  Keep the money  We just want to be done with this 
label2 He wants more money 
label2 Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen ?
label2 Thank you  Barry 
label2 Can you give us a minute ?
label2 Me neither  but what other choice do we have ?
label2 I promise this is the last time 
label2 It says right here on Wikipedia  A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties 
label2 You tell me  you woke up in bed with one 
label2 Why is he writing to you ?
label2 I'm the one who thought of Spockumentary 
label2 How long have you known Adam ?
label2 And what are you getting him back for ?
label2 My brother was mean to me  too 
label2 When did we get a wall safe ?
label2 When did we get a floor safe ?
label2 You have a will ?
label2 Will Wil want it ?
label2 You bought her a ring ?
label2 Oh  man  I'm sorry  that must have been devastating for you 
label2 Just like you 
label2 I know  I also can't believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it 
label2 Hey  buddy  How you doing ?
label2 He didn't meant that 
label2 Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters  you can focus on the real people who are already in your life 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Well  he's having a rough time  Amy broke his heart  the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who  That crow followed him home 
label2 Ah  well  what's this ? A pot of oatmeal ? Or  thanks to you  what I will now call gloatmeal 
label2 What brought this on ?
label2 Hey  I made French toast sticks 
label2 I don't understand why we're leaving so early for the movie 
label2 What ? I don't want to do that 
label2 So you're actually okay with invading your friend's privacy ?
label2 Not really 
label2 You just happen to have those in the car ?
label2 By stalking them ?
label2 Can I see ?
label2 I know  but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun 
label2 Okay  we saw them  Can we go catch the movie ?
label2 What happened ?
label2 I don't know if you want to do that  I was just  okay  never mind 
label2 You really should 
label2 Well  we're having everyone over 
label2 Otherwise we'd love to 
label2 Yeah  poor us 
label2 Really ? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr  Spock oven mitts ? Hey  the recipes are on my iPad  Will you pull ' em up ?
label2 My birthday 
label2 It's just the four digits  month and day 
label2 Let me see  Yeah  there  What number were you putting in ?
label2 You don't know my birthday  do you ?
label2 Well  what is it ?
label2 You don't know your own husband's birthday 
label2 Your birthday is December 2  you grew up on Perkins Street  the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1  and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero 
label2 Justin 
label2 Nice try  NSYNC forever 
label2 Face it  you can't stump me  I am the king of husbands  I know that you don't like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine's Day  I know you hate the word moist  I know '
label2 Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot 
label2 Sure you did 
label2 What ? I didn't know you had a journal 
label2 No  it doesn't 
label2 Come on  don't be mad  It was a long time ago  and it was an accident 
label2 I didn't even know what it was  I saw it on your nightstand  I picked it up 
label2 You know me  I'm a big ol ' bookworm 
label2 Well  hey  okay  Let me make this up to you  Sometimes I keep an online journal  I want you to read something that I wrote 
label2 Okay  Well  then I'll read it to you  It's from the day we first met  Beauty  thy name is Penny 
label2 Fine  Mmm  Penny's beauty  like our love  grows more with each passing day  '
label2 Well  you didn't read it right  The new Star Wars is coming  Gah 
label2 Be right there  Hi  lover 
label2 I'm sorry about the journal  I want to make it up to you  So I'm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook 
label2 Don't want people to see what  huh ? A little bit of this ?
label2 Huh ? Some of this ? And  since it's Thanksgiving  an extra helping of this ?
label2 I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy 
label2 Since when do you hum songs ?
label2 You were just humming 
label2 How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls ?
label2 Well  hum it again  Is that the SpongeBob song ?
label2 Whatever  Can we just get back to this ?
label2 It's just an earworm  It'll come to you 
label2 Is this what we're doing the rest of the night ?
label2 Which is crazy  since rock and roll is all about good customer service 
label2 Eh  that just means going barefoot 
label2 Put on some headphones 
label2 What do you want  a medal ? It was your gum 
label2 I love you 
label2 Oh  yeah  he got a tuba 
label2 Hey  can we please get back to work ?
label2 All right  just stop  This is ridiculous 
label2 Thank you 
label2 That's a trick question  right ?
label2 Yup  she's right  For every Newton who had a psychological issue  there's an Edison who was just a jerk  That could totally be you 
label2 There goes our shot at him living on the roof 
label2 I don't know  It's pretty catchy 
label2 Well  now that you can focus again  what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls ?
label2 Aw  Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart ?
label2 Guys  tickets already went on sale 
label2 I don't know what to tell you  but they're on sale 
label2 No  it's Steel Magnolias 2 : Even Steelier 
label2 Yeah  me  too 
label2 I'm also really happy  but I can't pretend it's for you  New Star Wars in three days 
label2 I think Penny has a point  You can see it another day 
label2 I know  It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him 
label2 Hey  We're going to the comic book store  You want to come ?
label2 You got it  Well  Penny might want to join us 
label2 What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart ?
label2 He's not that bad  Hey  Stuart  got any plans Thursday night ?
label2 We will 
label2 We're gonna have so much more fun than him 
label2 Yeah  he's on his way  Time for bladder check 
label2 Um  hey  Wil  What you doin ' ?
label2 So  if you don't like Star Wars  why are you here ?
label2 Yeah  No matter what happens  we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again 
label2 I'm really nervous 
label2 That's true 
label2 Oh  if anything  I'm trying to get my Sheld-off 
label2 How was your day ?
label2 Well  did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work ?
label2 None of that is true 
label2 What if I get caught ?
label2 Fine  I'll do it  But not because of them  because I love you 
label2 Thank you for seeing me on such short notice 
label2 Well  then you know her better than I do 
label2 Oh  no  I  I've worked through a lot of that stuff  I'm better now 
label2 Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement  not mine ?
label2 Right ? To this day  I send her a card every year with a little money in it 
label2 Oh  great  Dr  Gallo is terrific  You know  I  I've always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say  but she made me see '
label2 All right  well  after we talked about my issues with my mother  nothing too deep  just how she ruined my life  I told her about you and your drug  She said she'd be happy to meet you 
label2 So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week ?
label2 Oh  I actually did hear your eyes roll that time 
label2 Wow  that's amazing  I'm in a pretty great mood today myself 
label2 Well  we are  because Dr  Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter 
label2 Well  what are you thinking of naming it ?
label2 You know what'd be nice ? Name it after your girlfriends  Show them how much you care 
label2 Remember  girls  you decide what makes you happy  not your emotionally withholding mothers 
label2 What is happening ?
label2 And it's gone 
label2 Good for you 
label2 Let me refresh your memory 
label2 All right  here you go 
label2 You're not dying  It's just the flu 
label2 I wish that all the time  Usually before I blow out birthday candles 
label2 Well  you know  Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas  Maybe we should all go 
label2 That sounds really fun 
label2 So  the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas 
label2 Yes  And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party  you didn't have to stay 
label2 This weekend 
label2 Well  Vegas  but '
label2 Not this time 
label2 He's coming  too 
label2 Oh  great  Do that 
label2 Thank you  I appreciate that 
label2 Appreciate that  too 
label2 You're still not coming 
label2 Sheldon  I accept your apology  but you upset a lot of people while you were sick  I'm not in a position to just say you can come 
label2 You think they'll still go on the trip ?
label2 They're not going on the trip 
label2 That Raj'll be on it before we make it to the freeway ?
label2 Mm-hmm  Well  I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of '
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 What do we do  kick them off ?
label2 Come on  you pain in the ass 
label2 If I'm going to jail  I'm killing him  not breaking his thumb 
label2 That someone has a name 
label2 Fun  Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears 
label2 Oh  it'll be nice to finally meet her 
label2 Oh  that's nice  Most people her age don't embrace technology 
label2 Same as when we lost you at the zoo 
label2 Still doesn't explain how you ended up on the freeway divider 
label2 Hi  So nice to finally meet you  Let me take this for you  Meemaw 
label2 Can you please live with us forever ?
label2 That's my best friend 
label2 Did it ?
label2 Hey  What happened ? Is Amy gone ?
label2 Penny and I have dinner reservations that night  but any other time  no 
label2 You don't sound very excited about it 
label2 Yeah  just get it over with 
label2 Not really 
label2 I stopped counting at four 
label2 Well  you were right  tears 
label2 Excuse me  Uh  bad news  The ma'tre d ' said it's gonna be at least an hour 
label2 Thanks  sorry to bother you  But I said it like a badass 
label2 A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper 
label2 Okay  Thanks  Hey  I think you may have dropped this ?
label2 What are you gonna say ?
label2 I don't know if I'm comfortable with that 
label2 See if you can get a table by the window 
label2 What ? Why ?
label2 It's not what we planned  but this isn't so bad  right ?
label2 Is that a big deal ?
label2 Sixth grade  but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase  so '
label2 Mm  you watched The Bachelor a lot 
label2 No  they're not 
label2 Ha  ha  You married an old man  Tell you what  Let's do something fun tonight 
label2 I know  Food fight  I'll keep thinking 
label2 Let's see  What's young and fun ? Uh  we could go dancing 
label2 Are you actually gonna dance ?
label2 Of course 
label2 No  I don't need any fish nibbling my business 
label2 That sounds fun  When's it start ?
label2 Midnight  Really ? You know what ? Let's do it 
label2 Oh  thank God 
label2 We are young and fun 
label2 It can be  Confetti fight  Maybe you should take a break  I got this 
label2 Hey  Raj  I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system ?
label2 Ready to play when you are 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 Why oh  no ?
label2 Relax  there's room for two babies in this group 
label2 You're the other baby 
label2 Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken ?
label2 It'll be fine  People have kids every day  You'll figure this out 
label2 Hey  you know what we should do ?
label2 Go out and celebrate  But not your worst idea 
label2 And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile 
label2 There's no reason you can't 
label2 That's just research  We're never gonna make any money from it 
label2 Uh  these are strong  you should slow down 
label2 How is that a new invention ?
label2 Doesn't matter  He's headed for the kitchen anyway 
label2 Yeah  Why ?
label2 Wow  I've never thought about that 
label2 I really do 
label2 I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this 
label2 Can you focus on what we're talking about ?
label2 You want it  you got it  oh  you want it  baby you got it
label2 You want it  you got it  oh  you want it  baby you got it
label2 Oh  That was really an asthma attack  I just sold it 
label2 I think we'd make amazing parents 
label2 Way to narrow it down to everything 
label2 Well  where's that information been this whole time ?
label2 I'll check his room 
label2 One day  Right 
label2 And we live here  so we have no choice 
label2 Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up 
label2 Can I get his contact info ?
label2 He is ?
label2 Uh  nice guy  But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy 
label2 Don't say that to anyone 
label2 Are you crazy ? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale ?
label2 I'm sold  you're ahead of Bale 
label2 So  Mother  I'm surprised you came all this way for Sheldon's birthday 
label2 Oh  You had a party for your 60th ?
label2 Speech ! Speech !
label2 Batman finally came to your party 
label2 Okay  I'd better go in there and talk to him 
label2 No offence  but I've known the guy a really long time 
label2 Again  no offence  but so have I 
label2 Again  no '
label2 Leslie  I can't remember the last time we talked  So much has changed 
label2 Yeah  well  don't be a stranger 
label2 Seriously  Barry  stop 
label2 Sheldon  we've been together so long  it's hard to remember a time you weren't in my life  And believe me  I try  You make me laugh  You make me a better scientist  You make me crazy  You're more than just my roommate  you're my brother 
label2 Uh  Professor Hawking  if you just give us one second  we'll light the candles  and we can all sing together 
label2 Ready when you are  Professor Hawking 
label2 So what happens next ?
label2 Yeah  we did our own search 
label2 Well  until you just said that mean thing  kinda 
label2 Sorry  but we can't sign this 
label2 Thank you for your time 
label2 Well  what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves ?
label2 Well  our choices are we do this with the university or we don't do it at all 
label2 Or  if we ended up making money from this  Sheldon and I could split our shares with you 
label2 Of course  we can split any profits three ways 
label2 I want to say something obnoxious  but it is easy on the eyes 
label2 Guys  everyone is involved in thios  okay ? Howard's invention  Sheldon's math  my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid  Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now 
label2 Good one 
label2 They've been out there a while 
label2 You guys all right ?
label2 Howard  what do you think ?
label2 Hang on  Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me  too 
label2 This is cool  When was the last time you and I built something together ?
label2 If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up  we'd be set 
label2 Hey  What are you doing here ?
label2 Soup  sandwiches and emasculation  just like my mom used to make 
label2 You know what  this part isn't that technical  You actually could 
label2 I'll show you how to do one 
label2 After you wrap the body in reflective tape  the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal 
label2 Yeah  perfect 
label2 And it helps to have small  delicate fingers  So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast as me and Howard 
label2 We had a full spool yesterday 
label2 Okay  We'll be back as soon as we can 
label2 Penny says they're having fun working on the prototype 
label2 I know  I'm lowering the bar so slowly  This time next year she'll have a coin collection 
label2 Oh  Sorry  we can't 
label2 What about the girls ?
label2 Okay  we'll take ' em  But  I swear  if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2  it better be at least as good as the original 
label2 I mean without lying 
label2 Come on  We're a couple of smart guys  I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn't make us look bad 
label2 Oh  you're good at this 
label2 Hey  you were right 
label2 Who are you texting ?
label2 He'll never make it in time 
label2 Ha  ha  Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad  Spoiler alert  when I see you I'm gonna spoil it  You're a good friend 
label2 Listen  we did a stupid thing 
label2 So  these are for you  and if you're not too mad  we'd love to take you guys to dinner 
label2 Why are you pretending to be outdoors ? You hate it 
label2 Buddy  I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there 
label2 Because he's hitting on you ?
label2 You and I could still go and have a nice weekend 
label2 Okay  one sec 
label2 I bought a baseball cap 
label2 Uh  Hufflepuff  from Harry Potter 
label2 Anything you'd like to say to him ?
label2 I know  Did you see they still have a video rental place ? it's like Colonial Williamsburg 
label2 I was afraid he was gonna eat me 
label2 So nice of that doctor to just let you use it 
label2 And there goes our hike 
label2 You'll wish it would kill you 
label2 I don't think I've lit a real fire before 
label2 Right  So all we need is to '
label2 A scientist made that 
label2 To be fair  good at both 
label2 I've never played that before 
label2 Oh  no  it's like a horror movie  We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac 
label2 This game's dangerous  I could get you in trouble 
label2 Well  never have I ever used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink 
label2 That's right 
label2 I don't  I know  but this isn't a big deal  It's just a little savings I put aside 
label2 Okay  you have every right to be mad  And what you said is true  You do make more money than me  So I had no right to do what I did  And I'm so sorry  I hope you can forgive me 
label2 A couple years  but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies 
label2 Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars  Forty seven dollars once my nana's birthday check gets here 
label2 No  I do  and that's why I hid it 
label2 Uh  you have shoes you love  but never wear  I have money I love  but never spend  We're kind of a cute couple that way  Again  I'm sorry  I shouldn't have kept it a secret 
label2 Is it a secret bank account ? Because that would be awesome 
label2 Why didn't you tell me ?
label2 That's not true 
label2 If that's what you want to do  yes 
label2 Oh  yes 
label2 Well  that is the grown-up thing 
label2 I love you 
label2 No  he'd be Bat-Man-Bat 
label2 But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat ?
label2 No  if a man dresses as a bat  that's Batman  but if Man-Man dresses as a bat  that's Batman-Man 
label2 I thought you were back with Emily 
label2 You mean like through their window from behind a bush ?
label2 Really ? The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them ? How is that possible ?
label2 Seriously  that guy's dating two women ?
label2 Oh  Sheldon  we don't need a meeting every three months 
label2 Oh  you know what ? I'm not going 
label2 This meeting is a waste of time  Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure 
label2 You're the only one who eats them 
label2 I'm not going  you can't make me 
label2 You have fun  I will not be attending 
label2 Thank you 
label2 You're being ridiculous 
label2 Can you please talk to him ?
label2 Because I am tired of him always getting his way  We don't need a stupid meeting  We don't even need a roommate agreement  and I hope that sandwich does cause a party 
label2 Why are you taking his side ?
label2 Leave me alone 
label2 Oh  of course  because I'm the only adult around here 
label2 Yeah  that's right 
label2 And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed 
label2 I don't want to 
label2 Stop saying meeting 
label2 You love The Simpsons 
label2 Oh  good  go  You know  it'll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying  I read the books  don't get too fond of this character 
label2 Oh  I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense 
label2 If Sheldon's testosterone dipped  he'd become a butterfly 
label2 Stuart 
label2 I don't know how you put up with it  He's impossible  I mean  holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy 
label2 Anyway  Amy  thank you for sticking up for me 
label2 Well  they argue all the time  They aren't that close 
label2 Penny  but '
label2 I try to hide it in his peanut butter  but he spits it out 
label2 Son of a bitch  Why is that funny ?
label2 She defends him all the time 
label2 Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources ?
label2 You're  you're right  it feels good 
label2 You know  you don't need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement 
label2 From Amy 
label2 That's different  I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist and he's the creepy thing in the TV 
label2 I don't think so  Why ?
label2 It just said Italian sub  I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it 
label2 That's true 
label2 Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl's bike ? Nope 
label2 How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do ?
label2 I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken 
label2 The difference is she's bringing life into the world  and you suck it out 
label2 Sure  I'd like to meet her 
label2 Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore ?
label2 Okay  help me out  How are you doing this ? Do they know about each other ?
label2 Who's Frank and Alicia ?
label2 All right  here goes nothing 
label2 Good  it's not just me 
label2 Hang on 
label2 Oh  I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting  It teaches the different flavour notes to look for 
label2 Since my preschool got a bunny 
label2 We're leaving now !
label2 I smell nothing 
label2 Just a whole lot of Afrin 
label2 Yeah  mm-hmm 
label2 Thanks 
label2 But we won't bore you with the details 
label2 What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely 
label2 And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system 
label2 Way better 
label2 I have to admit  I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this 
label2 Would you like a glass of wine ?
label2 Maybe we should take a step back 
label2 No  I mean re-evaluate what we're doing with the guidance system 
label2 What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon ?
label2 Very funny 
label2 Well  not really 
label2 Not a lot  I just couldn't start until you walked away 
label2 I don't think you have anything to worry about  Raj is a terrific guy  loyal to a fault 
label2 Morning 
label2 Ugh  Too much wine 
label2 Hey  did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system ?
label2 Who are these people ?
label2 What are you guys doing ?
label2 Oh  let me try 
label2 Hmm  atom of hydrogen  Adam of Maroon 5  mic drop 
label2 Oh  hey  Penny  do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother ?
label2 Hey  Penny  um  since you're already gonna be at the airport  do I need to go ?
label2 Well  I can do without the 40 - minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life 
label2 I don't know what he's putting on those cards  but you are smarter than ever 
label2 Seriously ?
label2 That is very mature of you  so I'm gonna go ahead and say  suckah 
label2 When's the screening ?
label2 Penny's busy with my mother  so I'm in 
label2 You do realize we're allowed to have fun without you ?
label2 People do it all the time 
label2 Waking up  wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets 
label2 So  when the aliens brought you back  they just left the probe in ?
label2 He's just joining his friends ; it's fine 
label2 We'd still get in 
label2 Oh  please don't 
label2 Boy  I wish I could say no 
label2 Okay  you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here 
label2 Buddy  let it go 
label2 You did everything you could 
label2 Now  now  you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer  That's all anyone could ask 
label2 How'd it go with my mother ?
label2 Wow  Well done 
label2 Did she think you were choking or ' I'm sorry  that's great  Thank you for spending time with her 
label2 Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug 
label2 Look  in our defence  it was kind of a spur of the moment thing  and also  we don't like her 
label2 I just said why  we don't like her 
label2 Is your brother out of prison ?
label2 I'd love it if my dad could come 
label2 Oh  he's like a different man  He stopped twitching  and I think he grew an inch and a half 
label2 Sorry  but I don't think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding 
label2 I know  and there's no excuse for that 
label2 Uh  I don't  any day now 
label2 Hey  I  I know things are a little rough with you and Mom  but I'm really glad you're here 
label2 Penny's really looking forward to seeing you 
label2 Thanks  Dad 
label2 This is Sheldon's mother  Mary 
label2 And his girlfriend  Amy 
label2 And  of course  Mom 
label2 All right  you two  don't start  Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit  Can you please not ruin it ?
label2 Mom  please save something for the toast 
label2 Is that Howard in front of us ?
label2 I don't know  He uses that traffic app  Maybe there's an accident 
label2 What is his hurry ?
label2 Oh  we were following Howard  but for some reason  he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street 
label2 Uh  I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be 
label2 Cheers 
label2 My father's not texting me back 
label2 I don't like it either 
label2 We're not gonna be brothers  We're not gonna be stepbrothers  Go to sleep 
label2 Go to sleep 
label2 I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward 
label2 Yeah  drive safe 
label2 Well  why ? What's wrong ?
label2 Not helping  buddy  Mother  Penny and I really want you to be part of this  Please stay 
label2 I'm glad you decided to stay  It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you 
label2 Yeah  special  like that 
label2 Hey  guys  come on in 
label2 You don't know his girlfriend very well 
label2 Well  nothing happened  right ? It's over  Until we get married a third time  you guys will never have to see each other again 
label2 Mary  I'm sorry you're in the middle of this 
label2 Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom ?
label2 Fine  then you go 
label2 That still leaves me here with him 
label2 Oh  you  too  Hey  everyone  this is my mother  Beverley 
label2 Hey  I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute 
label2 That's okay  I can make it over 
label2 That was almost a minute 
label2 So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me ?
label2 What's up ?
label2 Really ?
label2 There goes our big payday 
label2 You do that  too ?
label2 Are you crazy ? You can't put that on Snapchat 
label2 That's the definition of being a know-it-all 
label2 I saw it  It's big 
label2 Someday  when I'm up on murder charges  you'll be hearing from me 
label2 ' Cause when you talk  it enrages people 
label2 I'm getting enraged 
label2 Don't speak 
label2 Exactly  Yeah  you have a good grasp of the physics 
label2 Where did you go to school ?
label2 I don't know how I feel about this 
label2 Oh  thanks  man 
label2 Well  the colonel said it was for the good of the country  and the funding is substantial 
label2 Oh  looks like it 
label2 Wish we weren't so far from my parking space 
label2 I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule 
label2 Is that a retinal scanner ?
label2 No way 
label2 I didn't even have to take my glasses off /
label2 Sure  I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander 
label2 We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you 
label2 Guys  we're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting  Now  can you please try
label2 It's been three and a half minutes  wake up 
label2 What is this ?
label2 Oh  that is so nice 
label2 So  what are you guys gonna do today ?
label2 You don't think you'll be bored ?
label2 : Look at that  it is a party 
label2 Oh  it's complicated  He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
label2 Are you okay ?
label2 According to the world's worst cuckoo clock  it's two 
label2 That's not helpful  It's fun to think about  but it's not helpful  Hey  Sheldon  we are on a serious time crunch  We can't do this without you  Can you please pull it together ?
label2 I'm gonna get some coffee  You want some ?
label2 Uh  okay  let's pretend you do have a problem 
label2 You don't 
label2 Your problem 
label2 Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem ?
label2 Right  Listen to me  We can't do anything until you do your part  So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it 
label2 It's okay  we'll figure something out 
label2 Um  I don't really know how to say this 
label2 Right  Sorry  sir 
label2 Thanks for understanding  sir 
label2 That stinks  How long are you out of the apartment ?
label2 Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water  Can't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing 
label2 And we live with Sheldon  so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning 
label2 Mm-hmm  For two of us  it's in the right direction 
label2 You just shaved yesterday  You're good for three months 
label2 That's a good question  Maybe just don't come over 
label2 Never leave a belt on the floor  At night  they look like snakes 
label2 Keep M & M'S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line 
label2 He startles easily  so  please  no flash photography 
label2 You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before 
label2 You guys have fun 
label2 Good night 
label2 It's weird  This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college  Unless they feel sad  then it's different 
label2 I know exactly what we are gonna do 
label2 Hey  Sheldon's not here  so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear 
label2 Oh  don't worry  Once you see my sweet moves  sex is inevitable 
label2 I'll just let my hips do the talkin ' 
label2 The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution  but not this smooth criminal 
label2 I feel like I pulled something  Why didn't you tell me to stop ?
label2 And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies 
label2 Hey  she didn't compromise  She settled  There's a difference 
label2 When you live with someone  there's gonna be conflict  You just have to keep communicating 
label2 Good  Then before we reintroduce them  we'll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again 
label2 No  that's actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space 
label2 Look  here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon  He's the worst 
label2 I prefer to think of myself as five-ten  but I still need to get all my pants hemmed 
label2 Don't beat yourself up  You've never lived with anyone before 
label2 Look  even when Penny and I started living together  there was a learning curve  But I promise you  it does get easier 
label2 Yeah  My record was six 
label2 Oh  true  but think of how much you've accomplished  Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change ?
label2 And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment ?
label2 How can you stop now ? That's like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy 
label2 Of course you do 
label2 Oh  He can try  He'd just need a good locksmith 
label2 How you guys doing ?
label2 Why does she get that ? We never got that 
label2 I'm very happy for you 
label2 Did we really need to be here for this ?
label2 It's cute  they're having fun living together 
label2 What do you mean ?
label2 So  she's just been lying to him ?
label2 Yeah  but to make him leave  not to make him stay 
label2 So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball ?
label2 You're awful quiet  everything okay ?
label2 I wouldn't worry about it  She's probably just distracted by work 
label2 Buddy  buddy  listen  nothing bad is going on  she just  she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago 
label2 She's enjoying living with you and she didn't want it to end early 
label2 Sheldon  this is not a big deal  It's a little white lie  everyone does it 
label2 Why would you tell him that ? That's terrible advice 
label2 Well  of course not 
label2 Uh  no 
label2 Are you kidding me ?
label2 Superman's gone  my stormtrooper's gone 
label2 I'd say damn it in Klingon  but that wasn't until next month 
label2 Khoo-vakh ! She took my Where's Waldo 
label2 Oh  yeah  there he is 
label2 Eventually  I guess  Although  I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing 
label2 Oh  my God  I'm going blind 
label2 jISovbe ' ( I don't know  )
label2 ghobe ' ( No  )
label2 Fine  I told Sheldon that her apartment's been finished  but then you just said it's not  so now I'm all confused 
label2 Bernadette told Howard  Howard told me  plus  I can see all my stuff is gone 
label2 You really didn't think I'd notice my stuff was missing ?
label2 Where's Batman ?
label2 Ooh  maybe I could turn it into a gaming den 
label2 But you won't be living here 
label2 But you won't be living here 
label2 You guys might want to start eating  But you won't be living here 
label2 Look  I get it  this is still my room  we haven't really made it yours 
label2 Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger  Put it anywhere you like 
label2 I'm kidding  I want you to feel at home here  Decorate it any way that makes you happy 
label2 I really do 
label2 What about my robot poster ?
label2 Over my assless chaps you will 
label2 Do you know what you need to do now ?
label2 No  no  no  no  no  it's  it's important to me that you have the bedroom you want 
label2 I love you  too 
label2 Just hiding some stuff in your closet  don't tell Penny 
label2 Really ? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle 
label2 How's that broccoli ?
label2 Oh  so she's an astronomer ?
label2 Okay  well  good luck with it 
label2 Why does he need a baby ? He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder 
label2 That's true  Sheldon's father once picked a fight with a cactus 
label2 Well  we know they were smart enough to send him away 
label2 Well  have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two 
label2 I'm sorry  is that a yes ?
label2 That is unbelievable  Good for Bert 
label2 That's Sheldon's way of saying he's proud of Bert  too 
label2 How much money did he win ?
label2 Yeah  good for you 
label2 I know  and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard 
label2 Ignore him  he's just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant 
label2 They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets 
label2 It's always fun watching him read someone else's work 
label2 What are you doing ?
label2 Hey  buddy  why don't we go for a walk  so you can calm down 
label2 Hey  I'm trying to help you 
label2 Really  why ?
label2 Do it  Visualize it as your anger and  and toss it out of your life 
label2 Let it fly 
label2 Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot 
label2 Oh  I laughed so hard  I burst a blood vessel in my nose  It's fine 
label2 Although if you are gonna do it again  please let me know  so I can get it on video 
label2 You're up 
label2 If it helps  I'm questioning your life choices  too 
label2 Does it spin around and do tricks ?
label2 Oh  how will we ever get used to the new you ?
label2 I think he might be learning on his own 
label2 Excuse me  I have to go take some pictures 
label2 I've always been jealous of how much money Raj's family has 
label2 Yeah  I loved it  Love you  love the hair  would love to change the subject 
label2 Oh  I don't mind  If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket  it would be like I'm walking with my grandma 
label2 Well  change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma 
label2 Hey  Sheldon  I've got someone here who might make you feel better 
label2 Oh  it was a good one  He played poker with Sir Isaac  you don't care 
label2 Hey  guys  what are you  oh  that's here  cool 
label2 Yes  you do 
label2 Sounds right  a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash 
label2 So you think you should keep it ?
label2 Keep the clock  Sheldon 
label2 You know what  Sheldon  take it  In fact  you can have everything  I really don't care 
label2 Well  now they're yours 
label2 Well  you know what's gonna happen  he's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his 
label2 Yeah  I like this one 
label2 But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they'd jack up the price 
label2 Oh  I do  The  the field of blue represents you being miserable  and the lion sticking its tongue out means I'm happy about it 
label2 Is the Wi-Fi working for you ?
label2 Oh  I knew it  Sheldon changed the password 
label2 Well  the new network name is ha ha ha  now I've got you  so it's either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs 
label2 You're good at revenge  how do we get him back ?
label2 Sheldon  I know what you did  now change the password back 
label2 Sheldon  I'm warning you  I can play this game  too 
label2 All right  I tried 
label2 Separating my delicates 
label2 No  last time that old lady in the park kept screaming  watch out  he's right behind you  Hello ?
label2 Uh  can I help you ?
label2 And just leave him here alone ?
label2 This is ridiculous 
label2 Sheldon  get out here 
label2 Why ? I said I didn't care 
label2 Yeah  thanks  but nobody asked you 
label2 Well  for me  too  It's not the same with you gone 
label2 You promise ?
label2 Well  I'm sure at some point  we won't even notice it's there 
label2 Damn  I need my inhaler 
label2 No  I went down the stairs too fast 
label2 I found it  but it's empty 
label2 Are you sure ? I'd really like to 
label2 Okay  I can breathe again  Babe  they want to have sex 
label2 If we find my backup inhaler  maybe we can get frisky 
label2 Found the backup inhaler  want to have sex ?
label2 Hang on  I'm counting  It's okay 
label2 Well  it is their child 
label2 It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid 
label2 It's not just Howard and Bernadette  I mean  look how far we've all come 
label2 Penny was a struggling actress when we met  and now she's a successful pharmaceutical rep 
label2 Sorry  Stuart 
label2 I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents  That was a big milestone for me 
label2 Yeah  Let me finish packing this stuff up  You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year's 
label2 Well  he doesn't live at Walmart  but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter  And that's the same man who complains you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter 
label2 Well  he didn't throw up on the baby  That's a win 
label2 Did you at least have a good flight down there ?
label2 And before our next drive to Comic-Con  I need the name of that juice 
label2 Hold on  How did you get him in the car ?
label2 Who knows what he has down there 
label2 Absolutely not 
label2 Absolutely not 
label2 On purpose  not the way it used to happen in high school 
label2 It might've been the worst one we've ever had 
label2 Well  we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together  and it was kind of our thing  and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me 
label2 Oh  yeah ? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con 
label2 Oh cool  I'll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan 
label2 Stupid idea 
label2 You know how easily I blister 
label2 Look  we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night  or  or we can stop and try to salvage the evening 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Do not need a break 
label2 If I need a break  I'll ask for a break 
label2 You want to decorate it tonight ?
label2 By the way  if anyone asks  the elevator shaft always had a tree in it 
label2 Ignore him  How did you get the baby to stop crying ?
label2 Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice 
label2 See you guys at work 
label2 Well  it sounded like you were having a rough day  so i wanted you to come home to something nice 
label2 and this wine is why 
label2 I made your favourite  Pizza bagels 
label2 Well  now be careful  these are hot  i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust  but instead I'm gonna keep it to myself 
label2 I quoted your favourite Nsync song 
label2 Damn  I burped so hard  i died in my game 
label2 That's nice  I wear a size eight and a half 
label2 Are you gonna laugh at the answer ?
label2 Because we just spent our allowance on comic books 
label2 Oh  no  Good game 
label2 Just ignore him 
label2 What's that supposed to mean ?
label2 Well  hey  come on  just tell me 
label2 What ? Where is this coming from ?
label2 That is ridiculous 
label2 No  no  no  no  let's talk about it  I'm the one who's made all the effort in this relationship since day one  Please tell me what more I could do ?
label2 Fine  go ahead 
label2 Mm-hmm 
label2 Have fun 
label2 Go ahead  it's fine 
label2 Thank you 
label2 Thanks 
label2 Earl grey ?
label2 Honey ?
label2 Sorry  thank you 
label2 I really don't know 
label2 I don't want to play a game  Sheldon 
label2 Its not that I'd stopped trying  its just how relationships progress  They start with infatuation  but over time mellow into something more comfortable 
label2 Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny ?
label2 I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out 
label2 I would pull this car over and kick you out  but If Penny dumps me  you're all I got 
label2 I came here to apologize 
label2 I don't understand what you want 
label2 Listen  we realized  that  uh  we're facing some new challenges as a married couple 
label2 What do you say ?
label2 Article 10  subsection C  if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn't  Other unacceptable responses include  it's nothing  don't worry about it  and  I said it's nothing don't worry about it 
label2 Me  too 
label2 What's going on with that woman you're dating ?
label2 You're not being very nice 
label2 Careful  I saw this on Star Trek  Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon  Hey 
label2 And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon ? Cool 
label2 That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them ?
label2 I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room 
label2 I don't like trains  You like trains 
label2 Well  when you get the machine  you can find out 
label2 No  Raj  that's a terrible idea 
label2 Hey  great news  The TV I want will fit in the gaming room  and if I leave the curtains open  I can watch it from work 
label2 Oh  Yeah  Okay  sure  What's going on with your brother ?
label2 Huh  Is that a good idea ? I mean  you think they'll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs ?
label2 Well  I'm sure he'll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon  How long do you think he'll stay ?
label2 Hmm  Who knows ? That's exciting  I'll get to wake up every morning and see if he's still here 
label2 Of course not  I mean  he's your brother 
label2 Yeah  sure  He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency ?
label2 How's it working out ?
label2 That's great  I'm happy for you 
label2 I said no 
label2 Fine  You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn't bother to ask me first 
label2 I'm not saying you have to ask my permission  but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay 
label2 Because I didn't want to sound like a jerk 
label2 Has he ever had his own place ?
label2 Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed ?
label2 Stay out of this  You and your stupid machine started this fight 
label2 We owe you an apology 
label2 That was six years ago  I'm talking about tonight 
label2 And  sorry about the suitcase 
label2 Mm  Penny's gonna call her dad and tell him it's not a good time for Randall to visit 
label2 Oh  you're his little girl  he can't stay mad at you 
label2 So you're gonna throw me under the bus ?
label2 That's because we are 
label2 We can't  He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter 
label2 Good for you  on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child 
label2 That's great  but the Air Force approved the specs  We're good to go 
label2 Can we please stop talking about poodles ?
label2 Fine  go for a little walk 
label2 Just keep walking 
label2 At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks 
label2 You're kidding 
label2 You can't kill him  he'll just respawn at the last save point 
label2 Hey  uh  buddy  I got you a little present 
label2 Yeah  Go ahead  open it 
label2 Okay  Where were we ?
label2 This train thing worked out better than I thought  He's home studying the engineer's manual 
label2 Four thousand dollars  worth every penny 
label2 Colonel Williams  Sir 
label2 As a cooling solution  it's pretty cool 
label2 Oh  nothing  Just some math we don't need 
label2 It's just a theory  Uh  it's not even worked out 
label2 Sir  uh  if I may  uh  we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype  It's a really elegant solution  and most importantly  it works 
label2 Sheldon  you can still go on the trip in a few weeks  Just help us out 
label2 Come on  you know you're not leaving physics  Why are you doing this ?
label2 Okay  This is everything he had on the board  I'm sure we can figure the rest out 
label2 Oh  we can get this  Is there any chance it's upside-down ?
label2 It's classified  If we tell anyone  we'd get in trouble 
label2 Just keep thinking  I got it 
label2 No  but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon  it will make him crazy  and he'll have to fix it 
label2 Yeah  I know  That's not even a math symbol  That's just Charlie Brown's hair 
label2 Well  Sheldon  turns out we didn't need you after all 
label2 Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are ?
label2 Just look at the board 
label2 Oh  no  what should we have done differently ?
label2 Come on  Sheldon  You can't turn your back on physics  and besides  you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff 
label2 This is an Euler's Disk  It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum  potential energy  and kinetic energy 
label2 But Raj is from India  which means he's no slouch at holding his breath 
label2 How ya doing ?
label2 Dig deep  like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants 
label2 Aw  that used to work with Sheldon 
label2 Who forgot to crack the window ?
label2 What's going on with your dad ?
label2 I'm sorry  is he waiting for someone to disagree ?
label2 Yeah  Well  we work at the same place as you  and we've always been fine 
label2 Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live 
label2 What if he lives in your garage ?
label2 Oh  you brought your own lunch  Good for you 
label2 We're helping Raj figure out his finances 
label2 What is Pink Cheeks ?
label2 Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control 
label2 We don't know  his mother never had him tested 
label2 No  Which will make me miserable  which is usually Sheldon's job 
label2 She's gonna hate how often we say the word panels 
label2 Well  she's so excited  I can't do that to her 
label2 That I would do to her 
label2 See ? Miserable 
label2 Hang  hang on  So I have to bring Penny  you can't afford it  Howard's gonna get in trouble  and this guy gets to have a great time 
label2 Okay  so this is the main Comic-Con floor  It's where all the vendors and exhibits are 
label2 I know  Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where's Wolowitz ? Okay  now  This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel 
label2 Yeah  It can get chilly  but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag  it helps keep you warm  Here's the hotel room we all share 
label2 Every hotel is booked  But  yeah  see this space here between Sheldon's feet and my head ? That's where you go 
label2 Don't worry  we won't be doing much sleeping anyway  It's like an all-night party  There's trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons  As we like to say  it's off the chain mail 
label2 I even said off the chain mail  and she still wants to go 
label2 Hey  I was thinking  if you want to do a couples costume  we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk  Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique 
label2 Yeah  if you want us to look like losers 
label2 Yeah  of course  why ?
label2 No  I want you to go 
label2 Now we're going as Hulk and She-Hulk  I don't want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con 
label2 Uh  it's more complicated than that 
label2 Do you think she's as honest with you ?
label2 Sure  or you can 
label2 I don't have a problem with your driving 
label2 He wasn't in a car  but okay 
label2 I honestly don't 
label2 If you want to drive  just drive  I don't see why this has to be so complicated 
label2 Why would I be upset ?
label2 Well  I just don't think you're gonna have a good time 
label2 Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn't ?
label2 O-o-o-okay  hold on  so if you don't want to go and I don't need to bring you  is everything good ?
label2 All right  problem solved 
label2 Now you can come with us 
label2 Yeah  Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend 
label2 Oh  how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland ?
label2 Aw  man  did you see this post from Raj ?
label2 No  He can't afford his apartment  and he's asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live  I want to say India  but it seems mean 
label2 We do have Sheldon's old room  If he really needs a place to stay  I guess we should offer it to him 
label2 Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first ?
label2 You know  we have the extra bedroom  and if you need it  it's yours 
label2 It's the least we can do 
label2 I don't have a loofah 
label2 Yeah  for a little while 
label2 And I think it's nice that you're taking whatever medication Amy's clearly giving you 
label2 Perfect timing  Food's ready 
label2 You didn't do anything  it's Sheldon  That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow 
label2 I don't know who you talked to  but that wasn't my mother 
label2 Look  just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone 
label2 Well  now that you point it out '
label2 Did you know Raj moved out last night ?
label2 Leonard and Penny  I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused  I went to stay at Howard's  PS Cinnamon's with me  but if you feel like messing with Sheldon  tell him she's loose in the building 
label2 Should we go bring him back ?
label2 Oh  that was just because my mother got in my head  It's like being possessed  but instead of Satan it's  actually  it's the same thing 
label2 Well  great 
label2 Just one second  Help  Cinnamon's loose in the building 
label2 You are not a burden  and we want you to come back and stay with us 
label2 I thought we were getting breakfast before work 
label2 It's cute that you think that  Don't worry about it 
label2 Well  she's done 
label2 He does raise an interesting point 
label2 I understand it  Sheldon 
label2 Who's Paul ?
label2 Oh  sure  Wait  Nancy ?
label2 Jerry ?
label2 I went to your office Christmas party ?
label2 That would be great  Thank you 
label2 Or we could do something we'll all enjoy  like play a board game 
label2 I mean  they didn't say anything  but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel 
label2 Anyway  I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun  too 
label2 Oh  it's just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around  Isn't that right  Halley ?
label2 A little  until I saw them in matching tops 
label2 Well  what am I supposed to say  stop having fun without me ?
label2 I know  but he was my friend first  It's like she's stealing him and they're just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together 
label2 You know  it's nice to spend time with people who don't talk about work like it's some kind of soap opera 
label2 I don't want to sound like a jealous baby 
label2 Anyway  I know it's silly  but since Raj moved in  I've been feeling a little left out 
label2 Thank you  I just feel '
label2 Well  to be truthful '
label2 Thank you  I '
label2 Hey  Olsen twins '
label2 Well  I mean  I'm sitting right here  You're talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation 
label2 I don't know  you pretty much covered it 
label2 Oh  I would  but we need to make a push on the air force project 
label2 I'm sorry  what is this plan you have ?
label2 When does that start ?
label2 It's getting harder to pretend 
label2 It can't be four revolutions  it's got to be seven 
label2 Oh  my God  it's seven 
label2 I got to admit  we didn't think you'd be able to do two things at once 
label2 I don't know  we came home from work and we found you 
label2 You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab 
label2 She's kidding 
label2 Well  it's not across the hall 
label2 But  boy  it is funny to think about 
label2 Relax  I know when you go for a run  you stop for a donut 
label2 I honestly don't remember 
label2 So Howard back Monday ?
label2 Hey  Want to join us ?
label2 So  Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend 
label2 Hey  we're all having dinner tonight  Why don't the two of you join us ?
label2 Don't you have any friends he can date ?
label2 Is that it ?
label2 No  it's always him 
label2 So  Rebecca  how did you become a personal trainer ?
label2 Nice try  I'm not going 
label2 Mm  just down there 
label2 And we lived happily ever after 
label2 O-o-o-o-oh 
label2 That's actually funny 
label2 Wow  that's a big step 
label2 If you're that upset  go get her back 
label2 You called on him 
label2 You don't have to go  You're welcome to hang with us 
label2 It's totally different  Bert's money might run out  but I can beg until the end of time 
label2 Sheldon  why are you jumping up and down ?
label2 Mm  if it makes you feel better  you still dress like a child 
label2 Hot dogs 
label2 You're gonna have to be more specific 
label2 Yeah  I guess 
label2 Honestly ? It's a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend  and it's not like we have a lot to talk about 
label2 It'll be fine  let's just go 
label2 Aaargh 
label2 Ha  I knew you weren't asleep 
label2 I have Sheldon  that keeps most people away 
label2 Oh  I know what he's saying  and he's not  he's not funny 
label2 She's doing amazing  She can actually make a side effect  like 10 % chance of liver failure  sound like a 90 % chance of liver success 
label2 Yeah  Although  when he was trying to figure out the tip  I'm pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears  You're not really considering working for him  are you ?
label2 Yeah  it's weird 
label2 No  no  I'm not jealous  I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now  and you make great money and you haven't slept with any of your co-workers 
label2 Of course I don't want you to be unhappy  but I also want you to be smart  and working for an ex-boyfriend isn't very smart  You don't have to stop  just slow down  I'll jump out 
label2 No  I told her she was being not smart  Which was dumb 
label2 We covered this  I'm dumb 
label2 Thank you 
label2 So you think it's okay ?
label2 That doesn't seem to be where I shine  How about I just give you one of these ?
label2 Yeah  sorry 
label2 Well  thanks  And I don't want you to be stuck at a job you don't like 
label2 Well  I don't love it  but if you really want to take this job  I'll find a way to deal with it 
label2 No  no  no  no  you're  you're unhappy there and then you're gonna blame me for making you stay  and it's fine  I'll just  I'll suck it up 
label2 Yeah  see  now I feel terrible  like I'm being selfish and holding you back  What ? Say something  Yeah  that is pretty annoying 
label2 Absolutely  I just want you to be happy  And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I'm being 
label2 Not if I want to be doing this later 
label2 Thank you 
label2 First thing tomorrow morning  we're back at it 
label2 Hmm  I don't care if this thing is burning out my retinas  it makes me feel special  Now  before we field test  I think we '
label2 It's a secure lab in a classified facility  only the U  S  government and us 
label2 Sir  I  I  I'm sorry but I just don't get it  You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn't even tell us ?
label2 Are you implementing phase two ?
label2 I can't believe the Air Force would treat us like that 
label2 Third floor  wrong apartment 
label2 She might disappear  but she's definitely not cleaning anything 
label2 You won't believe it  the military confiscated our project 
label2 Yeah  what's going on with you guys ?
label2 So  are you excited to have your own place again ?
label2 Ah  we'll miss you  too 
label2 I'm trying  This is the best I can do  What are you doing ?
label2 Sheldon  you're being silly 
label2 Do you really care about that last one ?
label2 Instead of dwelling on the negative  think about this  Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity  which gives you an opportunity to show her that you're a loving and supportive boyfriend 
label2 All right  let me start again  Uh  you and Amy '
label2 Thank you 
label2 Should we give them their privacy ?
label2 Shut up 
label2 Oh  that would be great 
label2 Great  Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot 
label2 He doesn't ; he just likes looking at them  Bring a book 
label2 Wait  isn't she the grad student that used to follow him around ?
label2 Ah  did you see that ? She just touched his hand and he didn't swat it away  What is happening ?
label2 Penny laid into me  too  Apparently  I'm overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars 
label2 If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after 
label2 Eh  I'm worth it 
label2 Like what ?
label2 You kept walking  I think you did 
label2 Yeah  she's definitely going after Sheldon 
label2 And you actually got in a pool ?
label2 Uh  so  Ramona  tell us about yourself  Do you  do you have a boyfriend ?
label2 You think you should call Amy ?
label2 You got feet and legs  you do it 
label2 Our pleasure
