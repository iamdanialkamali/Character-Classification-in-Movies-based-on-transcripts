label1 I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try ? Or in your case the old community college try ?
label1 You say it's itchy and uncomfortable  I say situations like this make me feel the same way 
label1 Okay  sure  I don't see a problem with that 
label1 In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a '
label2 Like  times two twice ?
label1 A machine that reads emotions is intriguing  It could help me be a more considerate friend 
label1 I may have a better way that you can teach me 
label2 What are you doing ? It's time to go 
label2 Hey  you got a sec ?
label1 No  she's my guest  If anyone should offer her anything  it should be me  Elizabeth  can I get you something ? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt ?
label1 How many dates have you been on ? Who were they with ? Where'd you go ? Where did you meet them ? Did you sleep with them ? And how much longer to the aquarium ? I'm getting kind of hungry 
label1 Yes  I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend 
label2 You just wave your arms a little and they fly away  it's not '
label1 I'm so proud of you ! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker !
label1 You know  I'm not sure  You know  you'd have to ask him  Excuse me 
label2 No  no  no  We're not fighting  we're just having a conversation 
label1 But I don't want a vacation 
label2 Sounds like a wise man 
label1 Mine was great  I'm going to be a mommy 
label2 What are you drinking there ? A little eggnog ?
label2 I don't know  I mean  if he's not nice  it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again 
label1 That kind of stinks ? Why aren't you more upset ? Did I soften the blow too much ? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting 
label2 Affirmative  with fever 
label1 Why are you here ?
label1 Please don't hurt my friend 
label1 Uh  wait  before we eat  I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj 
label2 Do I get a card ?
label1 I'm sorry  I misspoke  What I meant to say was my battery died 
label1 Excuse me  Before this evening goes any further  we need to decide where everyone is going to sit 
label1 Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon 
label2 And you ?
label2 Oh  god  I am so hungry 
label2 Excuse me 
label2 Sorry ?
label2 You guys suck 
label2 Uh-huh 
label1 The sound is cutting out  I can't read that  The video is failing 
label2 Trust me  this will be just fine 
label1 Against my will  In the South  pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion  which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna 
label1 And now we're going to turn it over to you  the viewers  to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments 
label1 Only 8000 ? We're wasting precious time  Buy it 
label1 I don't see why not 
label2 Screw it  I'm going 
label2 Really ?
label2 Yeah  you got me  I'm a Leibniz man 
label1 Excuse me  Hey  how you doin ' ?
label1 Oh  that would be good ! Sawing  hammering  eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis 
label2 Hey  I know it's none of my business  but where did the money come from ?
label2 Did she seem upset to you ?
label2 Yes  He  he's late because he's on his way here from 1940 
label2 What is it ?
label1 No  Dr  Feynman  If I solve it for you  you'll never learn 
label2 It is an inefficient design  for example Penny has a flat screen TV  which means all the space behind it is wasted 
label1 I'll be back 
label2 Wait for me 
label1 Some will be successful  some may be homeless  It's fun to think about 
label1 Greetings  You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler 
label1 Yes  of course that's why it's tight 
label1 Oh  as small as Leonard is  I don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch 
label2 Because you're taking all the fun out of it 
label2 Okay  well  tell him I loved him on Star Trek 
label1 What's your point ?
label1 That's very unlikely  Mrs  Koothrappali  If Raj dies  it'll be from frostbite  gangrene  acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear 
label2 You  uh  moving into the apartment on the fifth floor ?
label2 Okay  Mouth over beak and light chest compressions 
label2 It wasn't fun for me 
label2 Come on  he's not that cute 
label1 I'm glad you think so  That's what I strive to emulate 
label1 Yeah  I felt the same way about the platypus  You know  bird and mammal in the same creature ? No way  And spoiler  way 
label1 Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price  The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine  Right next to it  I was closer to it than I am to you right now 
label2 Okay  I'm hanging up now  You know there's no such thing as a k '
label2 Me  too 
label1 I was out raising heck with Mr  Wil Wheaton  Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet 
label1 Why ? I got away with it  Leonard has his toy  and he's never going to open it  so he won't know it's broken  And I have a toy that isn't broken  Everybody's happy 
label2 For what ?
label1 It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe 
label1 ' Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat  so what does she know ? And send 
label2 Well  now '
label1 No  I am not  And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100 - gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types 
label1 You're a carrier  All these people here are doomed  You're doomed !
label1 You don't even know what it is  do you ? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does  the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question  As I am doing so eloquently right now 
label2 I'm talking about important things like emotional maturity 
label1 Drat  Is this your card ?
label1 Oh  she is  She's terrific  and she's proving to be a valuable roommate 
label2 Yeah  come on  Howard  Hook that worm 
label1 Ooh  that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl  You know what ? You eat it  You're married  it doesn't matter what you look like 
label2 Yeah  I'm going to need a little more 
label1 It's what I do 
label1 Yes  I think you'd like her  She's extremely intelligent  just like you  Unlike you  she's tall  blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer 
label2 Okay  bye 
label1 Very mature  You're lucky I'm out of silly string  As I was saying  Leonard  you'll never guess who I just found online  Professor Proton 
label1 The question is moot  There is no way that Stuart  an impoverished peddler of picture books  would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler  a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia 
label2 Sure  we could write something up 
label2 Okay  I'll go  Never have I ever been arrested 
label1 No  the Flash shirt is because it's Friday  but it's nice when things work out  Where's your heart rate monitor ?
label1 I didn't say that  But no  I don't 
label1 Hello  Amy Farrah Fowler  I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely  Additionally  I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock 
label1 Really ?
label1 No  what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me 
label1 Oh  no  me as well  Uh  please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz  Why dot biz ? Because I just gave you the business  And also bazinga dot com was taken 
label1 Nothing odd  I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it 
label2 She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path 
label2 Sheldon  come here 
label2 I'm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays 
label2 Sheldon  I think this will work  Let's just try it my way 
label1 Dibs ? This is a university  not a playground  Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs 
label2 And you were worried about the romance  00:03 : 18914
label2 You're not a lawyer  Sheldon  you're just a know-it-all 
label1 I'm not saying people can't use tools  Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam 
label2 Where are we going ?
label2 You are so naive  Just like I was seven years ago 
label2 I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show 
label1 I couldn't poop this morning 
label1 I don't want to talk about it  But it's not a spine  I'll tell you that 
label1 Permission granted  Commander 
label1 Or instead of me 
label1 I was going to get my mail 
label1 No  I didn't try  I succeeded  In fact  I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig  Snowball  before he caught fire  It led to an interesting expression in our house  not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner 
label2 Next we need a teaspoon of pepper  which  I believe  was also the name of your childhood dog 
label1 Yeah  And if he ever goes berserk  I know I can outrun him  Coincidentally  that's also why I chose you as a roommate 
label1 I'm helping you with Stephanie 
label2 Holy crap  Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms 
label2 I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years 
label1 And now  as promised  the tangent  Sheldon and the Hell Hound  or How I Lost My Hot Dogs 
label2 Oh  okay  I just hope I don't get cramps 
label2 Uh  don't lower yourself to their level 
label2 Fine  Howard  what do you do ?
label1 What  a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff ? How scandalous  You naughty girl  you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me 
label2 You heard him  no 
label2 Watch out 
label2 You know what  I am sick of the roommate agreement  It's ridiculous  I'm your roommate  not your chauffeur  You know  I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches 
label2 Wow  How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time ?
label1 Oh  I don't want to know that ! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease ?
label2 What do you want ?
label1 Well  I must say  I am impressed 
label2 Must we ?
label1 No  you squandered your time with me  and the moment has now passed  Feast on your disappointment  much as the capybara feasts on its own waste 
label2 Wait  did you say wait ?
label2 Should I  um  leave you two alone ?
label2 Let's go 
label2 I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary 
label2 Do you really want him to write back ?
label1 A date  You and me  Dining  dancing  perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight 
label1 Why don't you show me yours first 
label2 Then just say go straight 
label1 Ooh  my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points  That's right  I call him Stephen now  because I checked  and he was not okay with Wheels 
label2 We're not living together 
label1 There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you 
label2 He's not saying it's a magic ring  You're not  are you ?
label2 It would blow up 
label2 Hold on  I put some real work into that !
label1 Whuh  are we still doing the dumb thing ? Okay  why  what's wrong ?
label1 Okay  I just did  What was it ?
label2 Sheldon ?
label1 I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me  and you treated it as if it were nothing 
label2 It doesn't matter  The woman's not interested in me  the woman rejected me 
label1 Everything I say is true  Now  of course  the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces  living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces  so  you know  pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace 
label2 Is that Bert ?
label1 Oh  none that I could see  I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do  I got goose bumps 
label2 Just get in here 
label2 I reiterate  knuckle under 
label1 Not quite accurate  The Macy's balloons are filled with helium  whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane 
label1 And no more singing 
label2 You don't know what a sex tape is  do you ?
label2 Yes I now  but '
label2 Mm  dreamily doodling Mrs  Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook ?
label1 Round two  Leonard Hofstadter  Darth Vader  Rupert Murdoch 
label2 Intellectually about 30 hours  Emotionally about 29 years 
label1 All right  Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do 
label1 Yeah  from when we went to the arcade three years ago ? I finally decided what prize I want  Hurry up 
label2 Hang on  Penny  do you have plans for dinner ?
label1 You've taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine  Kudos 
label2 nard : We can fix that  Let's leave 
label1 Which I also figured out by myself 
label2 Sheldon  We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you  So have an energy drink  don't have an energy drink  Order suppositories and shove ' em wherever you want  I don't care 
label2 Ignore him  Yeah  sorry about the breakup 
label1 Ah  Sweden  Yeah  home of my favourite Muppet and  uh  second favourite meatball  Okay  the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded  Boy  is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson ?
label1 Gentlemen  the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon 
label1 Yes  I am 
label1 April 12
label2 It'll be fine  You'll see  Sheldon ? Buddy ?
label2 Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea 
label1 Which one picks last ?
label2 Oh  I'd wait 
label1 That's very nice  Stuart  Zack ?
label2 Isn't that flammable ?
label2 You know  if no one's thought of this  yet  this could be a big deal 
label1 Thank you  Amy  I'd like to apologize  Your accomplishment was impressive  And I'm proud of you 
label2 Really ? What do we tell Siebert ?
label1 Leonard  do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat ?
label1 The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant 
label1 Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals ?
label2 It's locked  but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in 
label2 Let's get out of here 
label2 So  Hot in India ?
label2 Sheldon  buddy  I just don't think this is going to come together for you 
label1 I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously  And for your information  the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom 
label1 Yeah  well  take them apart and start with the edges  And stop wasting time 
label2 Will you hold on to this for a couple of days ?
label1 Can you believe this guy ?
label1 Yes  Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you 
label1 Everything is stupid and I want to go home 
label2 Um  since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer ?
label1 If you say so  boss 
label1 We get it  you won the game  Stop bragging 
label1 Hey  you already ruined Thor  give it a rest 
label1 No  no  he's over there 
label1 But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to know who's on the committee  Let's see  Oh  Janine Davis  Oh  dear 
label1 No  it wasn't  Uh  now let's tabulate the results of the experiment  I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me and I'm not in love with you  And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences 
label2 What was that ?
label1 You're holding two moderate spell cards  a small rock and a potion of Zancor  which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth  Your only move is to play the potion  lose the skirmish  and two moves later  the game 
label1 As Professor Proton always says  there is no problem you can't solve if you use your noggin 
label1 Science it is 
label1 It's a little stiff  What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload  Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick 
label1 I think it's her time of the month  I marked the calendar for future reference 
label1 Oh  dear  Mr  D'Onofrio's in the hospital  Why do these things always happen to me ?
label1 Don't be ridiculous  What would I do with corn ?
label2 I think what Penny meant is  the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny  it's like a cat riding a Roomba 
label1 Leonard  would you wrap it up ? We're waiting on you 
label1 All right  It was hell 
label1 I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store 
label2 Really ? You love them ?
label2 No  but you're right  I should march over there and ask her out 
label1 I don't know the first thing about women  but I would not follow her 
label2 It's also not pink and has no berries 
label2 His mom's been saying that for years  What's up ?
label1 Project Gorilla  entry two  I am exhausted 
label2 Well  give it a go 
label1 I don't need to outrun him  I just need to outrun you 
label1 It's a blindingly clever play on words  By appropriating his character's name and adding the S  we imply that we we'll be the crushers of Wesley 
label1 No  I don't think you are 
label2 That's just crazy  How would my going in there even help you ?
label1 And now you know as much about him as I do 
label1 Okay  um  what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department ? I'll have fries with that  Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences 
label1 Is there a problem ?
label1 Ow  We didn't vote !
label2 Goodnight 
label2 Oh  nothing's going on  Excuse me 
label2 Hey  who's ready for Halo ?
label2 Yes  we missed our lecture  we were almost arrested  and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee 
label2 We lived together 13 years  How can you be so awful to me ?
label2 That is so great  Oh  I'm Leonard  I live downstairs  Upstairs from here  but under you  Not under you per se  but under your apartment 
label1 Unacceptable  It baffles me why they don't simply let some of you go so that there's money available for my research 
label2 Nothing  just catching up  By the way  may I speak to Missy please ?
label1 What just happened ?
label1 Well  I started the list when I was nine 
label2 I don't understand 
label1 Tell her you're a circle  Flatland gals are all hot for circles 
label2 Are you drinking whisky ?
label2 It's just her facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks 
label1 Surprisingly  yes 
label2 Some perfect couple  He won't even share his food with her 
label2 Yeah  that sounds right 
label1 Why would I flip out ? Is it a spider ? It's a spider 
label2 Well  n-no  hold on a second  I'm not going to sleep with her 
label2 Yes  but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday 
label1 Howard  The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me 
label1 Those are the robes of the Jedi  the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy 
label1 If you'll excuse me  I'm going to pack 
label1 That's the best part  you don't have to  see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed  if you knew that she found out that you had lied  so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force 
label2 I'm not gonna schmooze anybody  I'm gonna let my work speak for itself 
label1 Howard  you're feeling better about me today  aren't you ?
label1 Leonard 
label1 I see  And is that open for discussion ?
label2 Come here 
label2 Problem ?
label1 Darn ! She found me !
label1 No  Origami napkin swans  that's the headline 
label2 What information ?
label2 All right  here's the deal  Sheldon is gone  so the tree decorating rules are out the window 
label2 You know what ? There is one thing I would like 
label1 I told you  walking 
label2 Because I love Penny  and want to give her the life she deserves 
label2 What's a dogapus ?
label1 Oh  no worries  I explained my predicament to our letter carrier  He was sympathetic  His exact words were  Got your back  Jack  Bitches be crazy 
label1 You can't be serious  If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense  I'd follow Leonard on Instagram 
label2 Well  our plane leaves at 9 a  m  Do you think you'll feel better by then ?
label2 What does your agent think ?
label2 I'm lactose intolerant 
label1 Oh  of course  I'll get that back  Like all my underwear  that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper 
label1 But if we show up and you're holding them  she'll think they're only from you 
label2 There was one time I put body glitter on 
label1 Um  Penny  that's where I sit 
label2 What's going on ?
label2 That's how I'm going to make it look 
label2 What is happening ?
label2 Penny ?
label2 You want to know what I think ? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you  or even smarter  scares the pants off you  and you can't deal with it 
label1 I think I have the same one 
label2 Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you 
label1 Why are you such a stupid head ? That is also rhetorical  I'm sorry you had to hear that 
label1 Look at him  just standing in line like he wasn't moderately famous 30 years ago  Let's go say hello 
label1 Oh  I don't want a broken toy 
label1 Incorrect  Obviously  the answer is cheese Danish 
label2 Yeah  Everything since the eighth grade 
label1 December 25  1642  Julian calendar  Sir Isaac Newton is born  Jesus  on the other hand  was actually born in the summer  His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats  Which  frankly  sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake 
label1 Oh  Penny  I know you think you're being generous  but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity  You haven't given me a gift  you've given me an obligation 
label2 Who you bringing ?
label1 Leonard ?
label1 All right  Mom  When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum  if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son  believe it  because it's true 
label2 When are you going to stop making Cylon toast ?
label2 Lucky bastard 
label1 Hang on  hang on a second  that's not our answer  What are you doing ?
label2 Wine ? I didn't say to give her wine 
label1 Why are you all smiling like crazy people ?
label1 Alright Kripke  that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together  Tomorrow  Yes  I'll pay  Alright  goodbye  Alright ! Time to learn rock climbing 
label2 Snort it down and keep eating !
label1 And male partners  Animal partners  Large primordial eggplants  pretty much whatever tickled his fancy 
label2 You know  when they were escorting us to the detaining room  I looked through a door  and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant 
label1 All right  fine  If we're not going to give it a name  can we at least give it a secret code designation ?
label1 Well  I appreciate your concern  but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do  I assume we'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota 
label1 Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis  so bad weather can actually make the day longer 
label1 That is an antisocial implication 
label2 Let's get ' em !
label2 It's not just the date  We haven't talked about anything  Big wedding  small wedding  indoor  outdoor ?
label1 Okay  everybody calm down  There is a simple solution here  Raj  take me to the train store  and then I don't care what you people do 
label2 Got it  Oh  There  Oh  yeah  Yeah  now I'm feeling it  Oh  this is great  I could do this for the rest of my life  Hey  speaking  speaking of things you do for the rest of your life  uh  did I read that you're on that-that tenure committee ?
label2 Oh  that's too bad 
label2 Okay  this was helpful 
label1 What  why not ?
label1 No  I crossed in the middle of the street  And normally  I wouldn't  but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout  and it was the heart of cookie season  Anyway  there was a police officer  and he witnessed the whole thing 
label1 Do you have a stomach ache  too ?
label2 I'm sure I'm overreacting 
label1 We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment  And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies 
label1 You have a sarcasm sign ?
label2 We've had this planned for a week 
label2 You want to work with me ?
label2 Penny kissed me 
label2 nard : The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8000 kilonewtons of thrust 
label1 Oh  God  now even you're smarter than me 
label1 That was different  They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that's why they hated me 
label1 Your name is Bernatrix  You are a warrior queen  You're strong  beautiful and tall 
label1 Oh  the project is classified  I can't tell you  Oh  I suppose I could redact the classified parts  All right  um  I came up with an elegant solution to the
label1 No  The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely  What time is your date ?
label1 Oh  well  I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie  and a whole lot of answers 
label2 And you promise you're okay with everything from the car ?
label2 Exactly  Learn from my mistakes  No matter where I am at 7:18 am  there better be a toilet nearby 
label2 I don't think I can go to the North Pole 
label2 Wow  that's very nice 
label2 You're welcome to come 
label1 Sorry  I didn't mean to offend you  Obviously you're not that familiar with Indian cinema 
label1 Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard  Here's your I  D  Card  your key and your lapel pin  Which Leonard was too cool to wear  FYI  part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work  the comic book store  the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air 
label1 And she wonders why she's constantly undertipped 
label1 My point 
label2 Oh  buddy  I get that you don't like it  but it's not really up to you 
label2 All I'm saying is give me a heads-up 
label2 Oh  are you still going to spend the night ?
label2 I don't know  It's all such a blur 
label2 You do ?
label1 Really ?
label2 Here's Spock's head with no body  Here's Mr  T's body with no head  Oh  yeah  here's Spock's body with Mr  T's head  I pity the fool who's illogical 
label1 Interesting that you ask  The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car  Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car  the lower level is a theatre '
label2 And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone 
label1 You heard me say blu-ray  right ?
label2 Why should I do something  you're the one who introduced her to online gaming 
label1 Offer them a hot beverage 
label1 Is there anything else ? Where would you like to start ? He refuses to pay fines when he's overdue with books I lend him  He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman  He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was  and I quote  just as good as the first one  If that's not irresponsible  I don't know what is 
label2 Where is everything ?
label1 No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong  the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon 
label1 That's no threat  My mother's always wanted a grandchild 
label1 Well  there's actually big news on the Amy front  She's been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals  She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine 
label2 Probably ' cause you got to see your man up there rockin ' the mic 
label1 Maybe this will overcome your reluctance  I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25 - year-old Mrs  Latham to get your libido humming  Check out those saddle shoes  Rar !
label1 Yes  while also getting in a solid dig at you  Pretty efficient  huh ?
label1 If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is 
label1 Well  that's the thing about factoids  they're interesting 
label1 How's counting going ? When I was in kindergarten  I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show  I think I got this 
label1 Uh  Penny  I  I have a couple of questions about your closet  Is there any reason you're keeping this dead goldfish ?
label2 Um  eight 
label2 What are you worried about ?
label2 Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country  but when they're afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything 
label1 Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity 
label1 Oh  I wish I could  but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable  so  like an operating system  I'm restoring my life to the last stable version  which was in 2003  the day before I met Leonard 
label1 We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker  and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out  I'd be obligated to do so 
label2 It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon 
label2 Oh ' uh ' no ' we don't live together ' um ' we live together but in separate  heterosexual bedrooms 
label2 No  no  no  This is not a fight  I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it  Now it's a fight 
label1 That's right  It's called foreplay  And I could make the case that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship 
label2 Oh  I guess so 
label1 I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise 
label1 Yes  hello  I'm fine  Um  I understand you may have a bad impression of me  so I bought you a gift 
label2 Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day  and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage 
label2 I hate my name  It has nerd in it  Len nerd 
label2 And instead of standing around watching  you can help us build your smaller guidance system 
label1 Oh  the walls are dripping blood  which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution 
label2 Not the time  Sheldon 
label2 No  no  of course not  Just have your relationship someplace else 
label2 Uh  hang on  Empty your pockets 
label1 Did you hear that  Leonard ? There's plenty we could do about it  Do you have a card ?
label2 Me  neither  Except for one night when the heat went out  Long story  it's ' don't ask 
label2 Are we gonna be much longer ? I really have to go to the bathroom 
label1 I don't know  but if cats could sing  they'd hate it too 
label1 You mean the box  right ?
label1 To comfort you  of course  No  that's not going to work at all  I'll comfort you from over here  Leonard  what you're experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit 
label2 Uh  what about that girl last year at Comic-con ?
label1 Amy  this isn't easy to say  All relationships are difficult  but even more so when you're in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions  And frankly  who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo 
label2 They never do 
label2 He's got Amy now 
label2 Yeah  Stephanie got it for me  It's kind of fun 
label2 What I'm trying to say is that  maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise 
label1 Face to face ? Are you going to wait for him to sit down  or are you going to stand on a coffee table ?
label2 Seriously ?
label1 I hate your apartment 
label1 My fever is gone  my sinuses are pressure-free  and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall 
label1 You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room ?
label2 So  Sheldon  tell us about your trip  Where'd you go ?
label1 I don't watch you 24 hours a day  I don't know what you do 
label2 If the word is pee-pee  just do it 
label1 He sounds like a sociopath 
label1 What's the bad news ?
label1 If we're just going to drive around aimlessly  the least you could do is take me for ice cream 
label2 Yeah  me  too 
label1 What are you trying to pull  Mom ? From the top 
label1 Very well  You seem to be headed somewhere  May I walk with you ?
label1 Excuse me 
label1 I agree  It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here  Check your messages 
label2 It's up to you  He didn't call your experiment stupid 
label1 Amy  Why would you give me a word ? Now  if I play extract it would be cheating 
label1 Please  Leonard  stop trying to horn in on my new friends 
label1 But I would like to remind you that in science  there's no such thing as failure  There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career  That man's name was  surprise  surprise  Albert Einstein 
label1 ldon : Explain the couch 
label1 If you weren't my friend  there'd be a hole in my life 
label1 I would imagine it is  This is my friend and roommate  Dr  Leonard Hofstadter 
label2 Uh  where what is ?
label1 I told you before  bears are terrifying 
label2 That's great  you guys have to go 
label2 How ya doin '  buddy ?
label2 Ah  ah 
label2 That's incredible 
label1 I know  They probably shouldn't sell those to children 
label2 Well  for starters  you've broken up with me so many times  which first date are we talking about ?
label1 You know  I had never considered that  Wow  that's going to completely change my visits there  Well  it's late 
label2 We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz ?
label1 Aw  nuts ! One '
label1 Way to kill the mood 
label1 I realize that  but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago 
label1 You don't have the authority to save places in the line  If I do that  I'll be cutting 
label2 Yeah  yeah  now that's you  obnoxious and insufferable 
label2 Oh  like Halley's comet 
label2 Well  well  well  Sheldon  fancy meeting you here  I guess the train store in Glendale wasn't having a cotillion after all  And you  you said you weren't coming here  either 
label1 Leonard  I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley 
label1 Alicia ?
label2 So  business in the front  science in the back 
label1 Ha  Keep dreaming 
label2 I was working with Dave Underhill 
label1 I've invented a science joke  would you like to hear it ?
label2 Marry you ?
label2 Excuse me  that's Priya 
label2 I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka'a expansion pack 
label1 It's called scientific curiosity  Now go get butter 
label2 Yes  okay  but I'm gonna be gone for three months  What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else ?
label2 Alright  it's shredded  what do you want me to do ?
label2 I won't be too late  I'm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night 
label2 It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster  Maybe there's something there  maybe there isn't  We'll probably never know  But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it 
label1 No  You went pfft  What does pfft mean ?
label1 I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago  and not a single person cared enough to comment  All that effort for nothing 
label2 Chilli cheese fry ?
label1 Oh  Duchess  look at me  My quantum gravity's positively loopy 
label2 Uh  there it goes  it sticks  I'm sorry 
label2 Or in this case  the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye 
label1 Alone ?
label2 No  because I didn't want her on my team 
label1 You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern  A B B A C  A B B A C 
label1 No  We failed in our noble quest 
label1 Why didn't you stop me ?
label2 Thank you 
label1 Yes  I'm close to a breakthrough  Ooh  it tickles
label1 Well  now  don't get defensive  You're oddly-shaped  but you got the girl 
label2 Okay  I get it 
label2 Next game  let's switch helmets 
label2 It's not about money 
label2 Yeah  we'll pick a date when we pick a date 
label1 I just told you 
label1 Oh  uh  never have I ever thrown  caught or touched a Frisbee 
label2 Well  at least listen to it through headphones  I'm trying to sleep  Good night 
label1 Yeah  that's the problem  it's too big 
label1 No  No  my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again 
label1 So  in a way it's like I'm your son 
label1 Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are  we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister 
label2 What ? Congratulations 
label1 Ah  that's my girl 
label1 A moment ago  when you turned off the TV in the middle of } during the classic Deep Space Nine / Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode  Would you like some advice ?
label1 No  on the contrary  I found the Grinch to be a relatable  engaging character  and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas  What a buzz kill that was 
label1 Oh  I'm sorry  was that supposed to be a secret ?
label1 Earlier  I came here to surprise you  I looked in the window and I saw you with a man 
label2 Can I sit in your spot ?
label2 I figured that out 
label1 Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech  focusing on M theory  or  in layman's terms  string theory 
label2 Hmm ? How much you got ?
label2 Yeah  Right  Sure  The thing is  before you guys went out  I spoke to him and '
label2 Oh  Well  good for you 
label2 It's not a big deal  Go shopping with Amy  and we'll save a spot in line for you 
label1 Kripke  you know  of all the people  Barry Kripke  I'm so Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you ?
label2 Whatever  There's no alphas here  and this is your project  You're in charge  How do you want to start ?
label2 Penny  if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep  you can stay 
label1 Well  I'm not much of a sports fan  but thank you 
label1 Yeah  well  you should be  Your socks were still in it  I had to throw it away  Anyway  I  uh  trust that you've resolved your conflict 
label1 You know  I have to say  Penny  I don't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this 
label1 You're making it difficult to love you right now 
label2 Oh  another hug  thank you 
label2 Oh  ' I love it  Oh  that's great !
label2 Just sit somewhere else 
label2 I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff  What are we gonna do here ?
label1 You don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying  On Thursday  I will have my day in court and justice will be done  In fact  I'm going to begin preparing my defence right now 
label1 It's certainly preferable to my plan 
label2 I think someone owes me an apology 
label1 Old enough to know better  You know  and now that I think about it  I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune 
label1 I'm transcending the situation  I'm clearly too evolved for driving 
label1 Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science  But you didn't bring him back  did you ? No  instead  I got Lincoln Logs  Well  you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs  but Pop-Pop ain't one of ' em  And now you're here asking me for something  to save you  Well  sorry  Mr  Kringle  but today's not your day  I'm leaving you here to rot  and I hope the ogres feast on your bones  I take the skeleton key  and I toss it into the chasm  and on the way out  I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly !
label1 Soon  See  I could've said in the near future  but I didn't say in the near future  because in the near future is three more words than soon  In  one  the  two  near  three  future  four  See  in the near future is four  soon is just one  four is more than one  saving time already 
label2 Yeah  I can see that  Sheldon  Halo night  Koothrappali's  You coming ?
label2 That's it  No more Thai food 
label1 What ? No  You mean this was all a ruse ? Oh  how could I be so stu
label2 Morning
label1 Nine o'clock ? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o'clocks ?
label1 Leonard  we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught 
label2 Pretty sure 
label2 When you left  you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter  so we came up with kind of a cool solution 
label2 If it helps you sleep  then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman ?
label2 No  I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time 
label2 No  her bed kind of ' broke 
label1 Yeah  right on  man  Right on  Oh  look  it's Harry Potter and 98 % of The Sorcerer's Stone 
label1 I'm not going to say another word until you people settle down  I'm waiting 
label2 We can't afford to lose any more time 
label1 Uh  just out of curiosity  why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this ?
label1 No  can't do it  Sorry  Quinto  you're going back 
label2 Ah  you're going off the grid 
label1 By playing tic-tac-toe ?
label1 Correct  You're not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery 
label2 Hey  I get that you feel bad about all the attention  but still  what you did is amazing  We're really proud of you 
label2 It's okay  I don't have to say them 
label2 Yeah  it looks great 
label1 And as an added bonus  the word touch comes from fencing  It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense 
label1 Oh  hello  everyone  I am happy to report I'm feeling much better 
label2 No kidding ?
label1 I have not ruled it out 
label1 No  you said you couldn't drive me to work  this is from work 
label1 I don't know what you're doing  but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar 
label2 nard : I didn't even know her 12 hours ago 
label1 You know  the joke's on him  Without the certificate of authenticity  that bat'leth is worthless 
label2 Yeah  I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie 
label1 Yeah  he's right  Oh  here's a thought  What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic ?
label1 Oh  Well  that's all right  There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented 
label1 And welcome to a special retrospective  where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we're calling '
label2 Oh  that's true  It's not like we can get in there 
label1 Does it affect me ?
label2 Oh  mummies and zombies again 
label2 Did you just quote Star Wars ?
label1 That's exactly what I told him 
label1 Huh  Yeah  I wonder if that's related to the 12th century Persian philosopher  Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates 
label2 Oh  my God 
label1 It's basically everything I've ever owned  Um  every book  every tee shirt  every piece of broken electronics  Just all of it 
label2 nard : Yeah  not a good idea 
label1 ( Knock  knock  knock ) Penny  ( knock  knock  knock ) Penny  ( knock  knock  knock ) Penny ( door opens ) I am very  very sorry for what I have done  Here's your laundry  I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished 
label1 Oh  sure 
label1 Yeah  really ? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them ?
label2 Thank you  officer 
label2 Well  how did you know about it ?
label1 If it wanted to kill you  you'd be dead 
label1 I don't see anything in here a woman would want 
label2 Wuh  what about what you said in the restaurant ?
label2 That was pretty droll  With a hint of ammonia 
label2 What the hell is going on ?
label2 And you're starting out with Sheldon Cooper  That's like getting your first pet and having it be  I don't know  what's a kind of pet that ruins your life ?
label2 I thought this was gonna be boring  but it's actually kind of fun 
label1 No  thank you  And thank you  ordinary person  Hey  you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes 
label1 Oh  God  Don't make it so hard on her  Look  the first someone is the deceitful you  The second someone is the delightful Dr  Lorvis 
label2 Alright  um  just  uh  let me get my keys 
label1 Hold on  I have something for you 
label1 Well  it's not just doing simple cognitive tasks  You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion 
label1 Oh  they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there 
label2 I draw my broadsword 
label1 Not so fast  Infinite Sheldon 
label1 Leonard told me what happened  so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage 
label1 There is no abort 
label1 I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time 
label2 Killer robot  We built it 
label2 Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  I'm gonna need more details 
label1 The motion carries  Good day  Amy Farrah Fowler 
label2 Well  it's Thai food night 
label1 I have mixed feelings about doing interviews  I like the part where I talk  I do not like the part where the other man talks 
label2 What do you think ?
label1 Excuse me  No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do  Siri comes close  but I know more jokes 
label2 You know what ? I've gone 12 times  Maybe I'll sit out this year  too 
label1 Well  I'm not looking forward to it  but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it  Besides  Princeton is in New Jersey  so it's not like you're gonna want to stay  Uh  I know it's not your birthday  but if you're interested '
label2 It's too small and too perfect 
label2 Except this is totally about my mom 
label1 That seems a fairly efficient arrangement 
label1 I'd like to say it's nostalgia  but every time I think of throwing anything away  my ears start to ring  and I get butterflies in my stomach  And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats  and then the  the rats get eaten by '
label2 Nice shot 
label2 What the hell are bus pants ?
label1 Like a gladiator !
label2 Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out ?
label2 Sure  If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians  while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you  and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her  and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you 
label2 Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make ?
label2 Got it 
label1 You hypocrite !
label2 Nope  Uh  uh  I might not know what I meant  but I know that I didn't mean that  Not this guy  Oh  no way 
label1 Would you like to talk about it ?
label2 You understood the math ?
label1 Grape  I find it the most mild 
label1 Oh  no  she doesn't even know she has it  No  I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle 
label2 Here's my chicken curry  Howard  your shrimp biryani 
label1 Okay  Amy will be here shortly  expecting the perfect Valentine's gift  so  you're up kid  Dazzle me  Go 
label1 Yeah  I suppose 
label1 Your driving  the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities  your constant tardiness  your singing 
label1 I suppose we could try to make it a celebration  but he died so young 
label1 Your turn  Leonard 
label2 I don't know  Yours looks like he has worms 
label2 W-W-Wait  what's going on ?
label1 That is apt and amusing  I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler  She'll appreciate the witticism 
label2 Me  too  And he was able to take a sabbatical from '
label2 Yeah  time's gonna fly by 
label2 She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system 
label1 Aw  for Pete's sake  Can we go now ?
label1 Yes  it's six against one  Stand down  sir 
label2 Very good  And then a laser will map the reflective surface  and voila 
label2 That's not an email  that's Leslie's facebook page 
label1 Professor Hawking  how nice of you to call 
label2 So  hang out with me and we'll have boys ' night 
label2 Whatcha doing ?
label1 Mandy Chao ?
label2 Oh  no  When ?
label2 I'm Leonard  this is Sheldon 
label1 And me 
label1 My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick 
label1 Guess I'm not the only one who watches ' 70s television crime dramas 
label2 I'm putting all this stuff in storage  We don't need any of it 
label2 Uh  well  it's not May the fifth  and it's not May the third  It's May the fourth 
label1 I said  ta-da  Show's over 
label1 Now ! Do it !
label1 Well then  you leave me no alternative  From this moment forward  we can be roommates  but we will no longer be friends 
label2 I don't know  um  if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second  given the surface area of this car is about 60000 square centimetres  that means 39 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos ?
label1 Yes  probably  But until we know for sure  how can I feel better ?
label2 Good one 
label1 Yeah  you and me both  sister  Now  please understand  I don't hold you responsible for your behaviour because  see  from an evolutionary standpoint  you're a slave to your desire to reproduce  But during the work day  when you feel possessed by amorous intent  may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases ? Let's see here  Oh  yes  Check out this oozy doozy 
label1 I suppose that's true  You're such a glass half-full kind of guy  I'm going to miss that 
label1 The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate 
label1 The  the revisions I made start on page four 
label2 Yeah  Although '
label1 I was giving clear  concise orders 
label2 People are coming over  it looked fun 
label2 Uh  excellent question  Um  I suppose I've always been into science  you know  My mother and father are scientists  so I was kind of led in that direction  Uh  pushed might be a better way to describe it  To be honest with you guys  when I was your age  I wanted to be a rap star  Like Snoop Dogg  but with a healthy respect for the police  Yeah  no  sure  you laugh  Just like my mother did  After I confided  I was derided and chided  my moms and I collided  She said my dreams were misguided  That's just a little freestyle 
label1 I know  The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating  soul-crushing rejection  Everyone was set a-twitter  Although oddly  no one tweeted 
label2 No  You're on vacation 
label2 Give me the phone  Hi  Penny  It's Leonard 
label1 I still don't care 
label1 A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags 
label2 Well  I may be a man  but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one 
label1 All right  but you're not fooling me  Whenever you say we have to talk  it means you want me to listen 
label2 They are not 
label2 What are you doing here ?
label2 Doctor doctor  Surgical resident  Smart  pretty  Let me ask you something  If your friend thinks he's dating someone  but he's not because  in fact  you're dating her  does that make you a bad person ?
label2 If you get him a job  he's gonna live here forever !
label1 Oh  hello  What can I do for you ladies ?
label2 Uh  yeah  uh  right here 
label2 Yeah  Penny might be onto something 
label1 You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs ?
label2 Why would I want to do that ?
label2 I just want to make sure that we're all clear  standard robotic fighting league rules apply 
label1 I haven't settled on anything yet 
label1 So  I win 
label2 nard : Oh  uh  well  that's tricky  Um  well  uh  Original Series over Next Generation  but Picard over Kirk 
label2 Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now  huh ?
label2 Buddy  I  I think you might be overreacting 
label2 It's nothing fancy  but it'll get you to auditions  and at least for now  you don't have to go back to waitressing 
label1 I feel so betrayed  You know  all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents  Turns out he's the other kind 
label1 Sarcasm ?
label2 Sure  Hey  want to hear a fun fact about mustard ?
label2 I can't just go up and talk to her  Howard  you talk to her 
label1 Oh  great now she's jumping up and down on the bed 
label2 Sheldon  you're always saying how much smarter you are than me  Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science 
label2 I'll be right back 
label1 That's my girl  What on earth ? What is going on ?
label1 Well  there's nothing embarrassing about that  your father worked with Lewis Leakey  a great anthropologist  It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting 
label1 No she doesn't 
label2 How am I the bad guy ? She's the one who married someone else  I'm the victim 
label1 In my present  it's in the future  In your present  it's been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot 
label2 You did go pfft 
label1 I was  but Penny didn't want to  You didn't want to  Bernadette  Amy  Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to  And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody 
label1 Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small  oddly-shaped man ?
label1 All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes 
label1 Why ? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American  He ought to be thrilled 
label1 Yes  but I was eleven 
label2 Well what are you gonna do ?
label1 Yeah  well  of course I do  Listen to it  It's like an earful of melted caramel 
label1 Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case ?
label2 Actually  he's a genius 
label2 How come you're not doing a mission ? You're just wandering around 
label2 Uh  yeah  sure 
label2 What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus  bayberry  cinnamon and vanilla  It's as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan 
label1 I don't drink 
label2 Or a real Batman  Hey  Stuart ? Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once ?
label2 Me  too  So what do you think ? Are we gonna get back together ?
label1 You can't live here 
label2 Yeah  it's just one sneeze  (
label2 Hmm  I'm a professor at Stanford 
label2 And you were right about my motives  I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex 
label1 I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying  angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair 
label2 Yeah  I'm glad 
label2 No hurry 
label2 This is ridiculous 
label1 Oh  yes  I  just yesterday  you had a  a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch  Did I say anything ? No  I compromised and kept my mouth shut  Like you should've  because everyone was laughing at you 
label1 I hope so  it was a snort of derision 
label1 You know what ? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained 
label1 No  they're private 
label1 So was my dad  And then he did 
label1 I open the chest 
label2 I thought I heard something 
label1 Amy  I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line  If that's not foreplay  I don't know what is 
label2 You know  you're right  I mean  it's from you  I'm never going to sell it  I'm opening it 
label2 Want some more wine ?
label1 Oh  no  it's all right  I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum  Sweet and enjoyable at first  but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness 
label2 Well  we sort of decided to wing it 
label1 Oh  it's all right  I do  Oh ! You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat 
label1 It was tornado season  And it was an aluminium house  Anyway  the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English  when I finally managed to convince her I was sick  she said '
label1 Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun '
label1 Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought ?
label2 You only had one 
label2 Not much  Bro 
label1 Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night ?
label1 I don't say anything  I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you've gone insane 
label2 Hmm  I can honestly say Penny 
label1 Wonderful  Although I'm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig 
label2 Okay  Great  How do you want to start ?
label2 Why am I the one that has to get rid of him ?
label1 Intriguing  Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains ?
label1 At our committee meeting  Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park  but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon 
label1 I saw you having naked sex 
label2 Ja  und later she's going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light 
label1 Well  perhaps you're obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman  Is that it ? Did I get it right ?
label1 It was pretty easy  And I think my background in mathletics helped  Barry Kripke was there  I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out 
label2 Oh  well  that kind of stinks 
label1 Mm  You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause 
label2 Don't worry  Sheldon  We'll be fine 
label1 Yeah  but you were neither 
label2 Slowly  like putting a new fish in a tank  You don't just drop it in  you let the bag sit in the water a while 
label1 Vintage ? Be specific 
label1 Why not ?
label2 I didn't make it back  The ship sank  I'm in hell 
label1 No  no  The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling  Weltschmerz  It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical  idealized world 
label2 No  I'll watch the end of the game  Besides  there's only three minutes left 
label1 We're just standing behind her  It's not like we're gonna say boo and scare her 
label1 Leonard  please  we can talk during our break  We have one coming up at midnight  We'll need snacks 
label2 Hang on  Black beans  not pinto beans ?
label1 Before you go  consider this  Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system  I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle  All yours if you're willing to reinstate the roommate agreement 
label1 Point taken  It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out 
label1 I don't follow 
label1 Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you ?
label1 You know  when my honour is insulted  and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove 
label2 Just explaining the theory of relativity  Twice 
label1 No  no  no  that's okay  I can fight my own battles  Isn't that right  Bawwy 
label1 Will that calm my nerves ?
label2 Careful  if you don't get it all  it'll only come back worse 
label1 ldon : Each more daunting than the last  Have a seat 
label1 To success without Raj 
label2 Uh  just give us a few minutes 
label1 Talk to her ? That's all you've got ? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies  I really expected more  Give me back the T-shirts 
label2 Actually  you don't have insomnia  You're sleeping now 
label2 Why should I let it go ? Why don't you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep ?
label2 Oh  so I shouldn't ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem ?
label2 Gonna be a long night 
label2 Wait  twice ?
label1 The majority of people have dark hair  Even you  at one time 
label1 I knew she wasn't lead car material 
label1 Alicia's non-musical  childless and pro-rug  She's still on probation  of course  but I like her 
label2 Mm  I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You ? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk 
label1 Yes  it is delicious  Physicist  baker  lover  what can't I do ?
label1 Now  how's about you get us a couple of beers ?
label1 There was a project I've been thinking about starting 
label1 Fine  You have very tiny hands 
label1 That didn't happen 
label2 Does it have melon on it ?
label1 Well  Stephanie  since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball  I guess I'll just have to pick it up  Have you ever witnessed a violent crime ?
label1 Seems a little confrontational  but all right  You know  we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch 
label1 Uh  Mylar balloons  yes  Latex balloons  no  Water balloons  I will jump off the roof and aim for your car 
label2 Oh  hey buddy 
label1 I take it back  I'm scared of turbulence !
label1 Do you make it with milk or water ?
label1 Look at him  caring about what's wrong with me  That is some top-shelf empathy  Hey  well  we should start a club 
label1 Because if she hadn't  she'd still be wading through the list 
label2 Is that even possible ?
label1 What ? But he's a mediocre academic  And according to Beverley  his sexual prowess is sub-par  He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate 
label2 He just made her laugh  something's wrong 
label2 Oh  my God  you are amazing  I mean  I don't deserve you  Wh  what do  what do you mean everybody ?
label2 Mmm  in my family  holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society 
label1 He must be very skilled at coitus 
label2 Oh  she's mad at me because she just found out she's married to Zack 
label1 It's Penny's fault 
label1 Leonard  listen to me '
label1 Okay  so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest  or fort off  are  Fort Knox  Fort Ticonderoga  Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket 
label2 Me  too  So  you ever think about it ?
label2 Screw you guys  I'm gonna go see if she's home 
label2 You know  it's not exactly glamorous up there  The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other's recycled urine 
label1 Sarcasm ?
label1 Are there beans in it ?
label2 Your father's a gynaecologist 
label1 Because '
label2 Okay  look  Sheldon  the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller  and we can't do it without you 
label1 Yes  the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic  The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman  The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel 
label2 Oh  relax  She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan 
label1 I think you'll like the drill tonight  I've tried to make it fun  Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event  Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada  Pick a catastrophe  any catastrophe 
label1 I called Leonard because I failed  And I didn't want you to think less of me 
label2 Yes  you're forbidden 
label2 So you're not judging me ?
label2 Well  well  we might want to live together 
label1 I believe you 
label2 And it's the happiest day of our lives 
label1 Leonard  she's doing it again 
label1 It's not hard  one in five  Now you know why I'm pouting 
label2 Okay  I have just one question for you  While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us  you said that you didn't want to go out with me because I was too smart for you ! Well  news flash  lady  David Underhill is ten times smarter than me ! You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers ! Next to him  I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes ! So  my question is  what's up with that ?
label1 So you're attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain 
label1 Nice  You mean  like at parks and schools ?
label2 I think you're the one who fell over 
label1 Uh  I'm in Kingman  Arizona  and  uh  I need you to come pick me up 
label1 Snap what ?
label1 There are no do-overs in Wii bowling 
label1 Oh  it's no trouble  it's actually a pleasure 
label1 Good for you  Sign here 
label1 Of course there's  there's always your apartment 
label2 What does that have to do with me and women ?
label1 That's a risk I'm willing to take 
label2 Is that your laundry ? You only have  like  six things in there 
label1 Now you're being a responsible patient  Now  you may notice some tingling 
label1 Wait  What ?
label2 Okay  now  what I'm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself  and you wish I'd be more succinct 
label1 In 1890  Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature  A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets 
label2 Let me see  let me see  One calls it insightful and innovative  We're insightful and innovative 
label1 Stop it  both of you  All this fighting  I might as well be back with my parents ! Damn it  George  I told you if you didn't quit drinkin I'd leave you ! Well  I guess that makes you a liar  ' cause I'm drunk as hell and you're still here ! Stop yelling ! You're making Sheldon cry ! I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry ! That I let you name him Sheldon 
label1 Leonard  I am overwhelmed  Everything is changing and it's simply too much  I need to get away and think 
label1 Oh  Penny ? Penny ?
label1 I'll tell you what  if my apples are mealy  we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout  Heck  you can even push the cart  Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence 
label1 ' tion  Okay  For the sake of argument  let's say I have a problem  What would be your plan for addressing it ?
label2 Oh  come on  you know that's not true 
label1 Are you sure ? It just doesn't feel as innocent as it used to 
label2 Okay  how about this ? I'll do the talking  you just stand behind me and try to look formidable 
label2 Is that what you want ?
label1 He's not wrong  It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love 
label1 Sheldon  Sheldon Cooper 
label2 We are communicating through the wall 
label1 May I come in ?
label2 Why ? Because I got an ugly  itchy sweater  and my brother got a car ? No  I was her favorite 
label1 You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work 
label1 Will you stop it  This is a classroom  This is not American Bandstand 
label2 Sheldon's onion ring  Just put it back !
label1 Eh  well  very well  Oh  and on the topic of sharing things that are yours  there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fianc'e as we speak 
label2 What the hell ? What's the matter ?
label2 Okay  I'll sign it !
label2 No  you are now nothing  You have no connection to this project whatsoever 
label2 Oh  Dr  Siebert  twelve o'clock 
label2 Happy birthday  buddy 
label2 Uh-huh  I can already feel it working 
label2 What do you mean ?
label1 Or fornication  Yeah  But that has judgmental overtones  so I'll hold that in reserve 
label2 Come on  Barry  there's a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us  Can't you spare any ?
label2 Once again  I  I'm really not much of a dancer 
label1 Anyway  I'll leave you be  I have to  oh  oh  he's expecting a newspaper in the morning  Apparently  they still make them 
label1 Those are Howard's 
label2 Fine  don't tell me 
label1 Mmm  mmm  mmm  That's Eye-talian 
label1 Well  I don't know  we're all Groot ? Just tell me 
label2 Alright  I'll be right back 
label1 Well  it makes perfect sense  Because you're an expectant mother  you can't drink alcohol  I don't like to  You can't have sushi  I don't like to  You can't go in hot tubs  I consider them vats of sweaty people soup 
label2 Hey  you got Snoopy out  Can I have a snowcone ?
label2 Gets us out of our heads  You get in your head  you start to overthink  overanalyze  obsess  you worry  That's not what we're doing tonight  Tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins 
label1 Nothing  I just really didn't want to come  Virgin diet cuba libre please 
label1 All right  I've had enough  Attention  everyone  I m Dr  Sheldon Cooper  As many of you in the physics department might know  my career trajectory has taken a minor detour 
label2 Oh  hey  I just heard back from the liquid helium guy 
label1 Oh  well 
label1 I suppose so  But if I get out of the line  I'll lose my spot 
label2 Sure  when is scary not good ? But  okay  um  I have feelings  right ?
label2 So  basically  this is what's called mag-lev technology  It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity  Here  you hold this 
label1 But Meemaw just made cookies 
label1 On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge  so  you know  I could separate radioactive isotopes 
label2 Good boy  Here's a cookie 
label2 I just can't figure out what happened  I put my left leg in  I took my left leg out  I put my left leg in  and something just snapped 
label2 I saw what you did there 
label1 Pay attention  Leonard  That's why she can't play on Sunday 
label2 If that's so  what if I start talking to a girl ?
label1 Oh  Penny  I'm trying to take an interest in other people  Uh  how was your girls night ?
label1 That criticism will come later in your report card 
label2 Okay  good luck 
label2 It was not a crisis  Apparently  I favoured the left one  she got a little lopsided 
label2 I was wrong  there's three excuses for that 
label2 Maybe we should give them some privacy 
label2 Okay  I'm going to ask you one more time  we did the work together  lets present the paper together 
label2 What are these ?
label1 Stop  We can't do this  it's not right 
label1 I think I'm hysterical 
label2 It's not gonna be the same without you 
label2 You should visit more often  What are you doing ?
label2 It's just for my notebooks  Thanks  Penny 
label1 Well  you're the doctor  but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound 
label2 Uh  cream 
label1 As well you should  But I'm going to make an exception here 
label2 nard : There's three ?
label1 Well  I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC  It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids  but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts 
label2 You're the one who told Amy in the first place 
label1 All righty ! An 82 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena  reducing mighty edifices to dust  engulfing the city in flames  The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded  Oh  excellent choice  Now  put on your hard hat and safety vest 
label1 The Dark Knight has your back  He's scared  but he has your back 
label2 Okay  that's it  you're fired 
label2 I'll friend you on Facebook 
label1 Well  don't get me wrong  Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff  But  you know  when it connects to physics  gas up the Ford  Martha  we're going for a drive 
label1 Well  there's really not much left to tell  I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase  so  I got an earring 
label2 Well  are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment ?
label1 My pleasure  Ira 
label1 Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things ?
label2 Forget the parties 
label2 And he can't wait to meet you  too  Can I get anyone a drink ?
label1 It worked  It really worked  They said I was mad  but it worked 
label1 But that's my room 
label1 I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate 
label1 You think you don't care ?
label1 How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C ? Is that imaginary ? I don't think so 
label2 Sheldon  dinner's here 
label1 Why are you waving a white flag ?
label1 I will yield 
label1 ldon : You asked what I wanted  I wanted to come in  I'm here because you violated our roommate agreement  Specifically  section eight  visitors  subsection C  females  paragraph four  coitus  Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus  '
label1 Oh  yes  You should've been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008 
label2 Uh-huh 
label2 Is that what he's drinking ? It's not even real beer 
label1 Two trains ?
label2 I don't know what that is  but if it means I can go home and sleep  then yes 
label2 It's never safe 
label1 It's only one colour 
label2 Pukhpa 
label2 Sheldon  do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery ?
label2 We understand  Thank you so much 
label1 I don't feel different  this alcohol's defective 
label2 Why do I have to talk to Penny ? She's not my girlfriend 
label1 Could have beaten around the bush a little 
label2 He's not going to have intercourse with Penny 
label2 I also love you 
label2 Still get in 
label2 Oh  come on  no  that's not what I meant 
label2 Really ? Maybe sleep has met you before 
label2 Oh  wait  here  almost forgot  Here 
label2 Maybe I heard you wrong  A lot of words sound like yoga 
label1 Oh  like a charm  unnamed crewman in a red shirt 
label2 A joke  Okay  How about this  um  okay  uh there's this farmer  and he has these chickens  but they won't lay any eggs  So  he calls a physicist to help  The physicist then does some calculations  and he says  um  I have a solution  but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum 
label2 Thank you 
label2 You talk to Howard lately ?
label2 Okay  I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me  I mean  you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery 
label1 I suppose so 
label2 I didn't tell Sheldon  so we could have a few days alone 
label1 I finally have the time to test my hypothesis  about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins  and its impact vis-a-vis taste 
label2 No kidding 
label1 Are you sure  There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk  For example  I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time 
label1 Some York Peppermint Patties  a couple of Dr  Peppers  and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana 
label1 I didn't have to  the dates just happened to coincide 
label1 I'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect 
label2 Well  glad you're feeling better 
label1 Okay  look  how about this ? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson  If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made  he'll reach out to me 
label2 Not really  I googled how to do that  So  listen  have you ever made a pact with someone ?
label1 No  thank you  I'm not eating pizza tonight 
label1 Well  if I didn't think you could handle it  I wouldn't be asking 
label1 Sweaty ? Unhygienic ? Looks dumb ? Take your pick 
label2 Mm-hmm  And ?
label2 Yeah  um  so  hey  speaking of money  how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve ?
label1 I want that one 
label1 Aw  Amy  that was lovely  You know  this is fun  Let's do more  Someone else say something wonderful about me 
label1 Good news  Raj  I got the blood work back from the lab  You're okay to stay for a while 
label1 Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute  FYI  my mother's birthday is coming up  I'm going to need you to pick up a present 
label2 Okay  look  no Penny  I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid  and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less  for lack of a better word  violated  maybe we could talk about this some more 
label1 Why not ?
label1 There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o  J-A-M-E-S  C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L  And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o  There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o  A-M-E-S '
label2 What else would it be ?
label1 Well  wealthy means a lot of money  and vastly means even more  I'm not sure what's tripping you up 
label1 Is it any wonder he doesn't have a doctorate ?
label2 At least they don't know it was you 
label1 So we have to go back 
label2 What's going on ?
label1 This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary  Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don't 
label1 I don't think that's a good idea 
label2 We're here to see Koothrappali  not kill Batman 
label2 Did I do something ? I mean  I tried to be friends with Zack  like you said  which believe me  was difficult  given how you and me used to be  you know  you and me  and now you and him are you and him 
label1 This is kind of creepy 
label2 I feel awful 
label2 Oh  yeah  sure  let me just put this in a travel mug 
label2 Really ? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams ?
label2 I gotta tell you guys  I'm a little worried about Sheldon 
label2 Sheldon's office ? Is she lost ?
label1 What's her name ?
label2 Then why did I have to crawl ?
label2 You have any ideas  Raj ?
label2 Uh  Theodore  how long are you planning to stay exactly ?
label1 So  what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition ?
label1 Oh  there it is  tacos 
label1 Okay  Leonard  I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low 
label2 Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland ?
label2 It's an annual science conference  We've all been invited to speak 
label2 Admit it  you're a little turned on 
label2 Thermal ? ' Cause it's gonna be cold 
label1 Gentlemen  if I may interject  I've decided my rank will be captain  If it's good enough for Kirk  Crunch and Kangaroo  it's good enough for me 
label1 Yes  yes  Yeah  I'm definitely going with colonoscopy 
label1 You don't  but the surgeon might  hmm ? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland 
label1 Well  neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies  You know  That doesn't stop you from pawing at me like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets 
label2 Sorry  How did it go ?
label1 Superb  This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits  Nice hat  Bob Tahecin 
label2 What do you think ?
label1 Eh  I don't know  I am her precious little boy  And you did take my flower 
label2 Oh  my God  What happened ?
label1 Oh yes  it's quite extensive  But if we complete it  we get a free expansion pack  75 additional quests 
label1 No  She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory 
label1 I went to the market with Penny 
label1 Great  Now Mandarin 
label2 How did I do that ? I got to remember how I did that 
label1 No  The cushion is merely symbolic  I'm giving you my spot on the couch 
label1 That doesn't seem likely  Her bed's of sturdy construction  Even the addition
label1 Gentlemen 
label2 You do have a problem with her hanging out with me 
label1 Wait  it's not all pants  there's one shirt 
label1 Okay  one vote for  one vote against  Leonard  you're the tiebreaker 
label2 Fine  But mark my words  this frustrating  bogus teenage make-out session is not over 
label1 I don't know the future  Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth  destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it ?
label2 No  I assumed it would be good  Then I read it 
label1 Well  I hope it's with a third good option  because these first two  buh 
label2 Let's see  Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken 
label1 Fighting for our friendship  As peculiar and annoying as you can be  you're still my little buddy  I'm not going to let that end here tonight  Now put down that drink  let's meet Brent Spiner and go home 
label1 Oh  that is infuriating  Ooh  look  they went back up again  Terrific  Oh  no  they went back down 
label2 What you doing ?
label1 I'm not surprised  considering the way you talk about them behind their backs 
label1 It's about Amy 
label1 Am I in trouble ? Did my mother call you ?
label2 Thank you  Dr  Cooper 
label1 Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room 
label2 Come on  I take care of him all day long  You do it for once 
label2 I couldn't say that  I would have to say  you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again 
label2 I heard of ' em  Didn't know they were a band  Sheldon  she's gone  You can turn off the blender 
label1 Good what ?
label1 How about dolphins ?
label1 Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays 
label1 Affirmative  Computer  this is Dr  Sheldon Cooper  Activate self-destruct sequence  Code 1-1- A - 2 - B 
label2 I didn't steal anyone 
label1 I want you to crawl back to him and apologize 
label2 Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort  organise and label the entire world around them ?
label2 It was the heat of the moment 
label1 For shame  Leonard  For shame  And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you 
label1 I'm surprised to see you here 
label1 See  that's exactly what happened to me  except that I said it on purpose  and I have no regrets 
label1 All righty 
label2 Next level 
label1 I tried reaching out to my mother  but she was in Bible study  Leonard's mother is on a book tour  My Mee-Maw was taking a nap  and after a while Siri started repeating her answers 
label1 People usually start a meeting with a joke  but you go ahead  end with one 
label1 No  it's the accepted convention  How was your day ?
label1 No  it's not the Never mind 
label2 I paid two hundred dollars for my share 
label1 Well  I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia  Now  as I was saying  based on the content '
label1 Ooh  we already have our first call 
label2 You're welcome  I just wanted to put that out there 
label2 Because I'm Frodo 
label1 Oh  You must be one of those dessert before dinner people 
label1 Yeah  but we don't have to debate this  We're scientists  We can conduct our own research  I propose that we imprison two street people and '
label2 No  I'm having a moral crisis 
label1 Are you still depressed because you're alone  and no one loves you ?
label1 It's fascinating  Let me see if I can duplicate the result  Howard  I've always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit  Care to weigh in ?
label1 I am facing a great deal of work  And I do like things better when famous people also like them 
label2 I'm sorry  Just  just give me another chance 
label1 Oh  dear  Penny  have you been recording shows on our DVR again ?
label1 Actually  we met online 
label1 Wonderful security system if we're attacked by a school of tuna 
label2 They don't  that's why I saved this one 
label1 Oh  no  I see the confusion  No  the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill  When you're feeling better  you'll think that's funny 
label2 Do anything interesting today ?
label1 Nine years  11 months and three weeks ago  he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over 
label2 To the tar pits 
label1 Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice ?
label2 Just pick another game 
label2 Okay  partner  let's do it 
label2 Sure  what's up ?
label2 Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun ?
label1 I'm the child she was worried about ? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn't power a potato clock  if I spotted them the potato 
label1 That's interesting  Leonard can't process corn 
label2 Was that a flask ?
label2 Okay  this is getting a little hard to not take personally 
label1 There is nothing to say  Except I'm the bigger man  I'm not kidding  Say it 
label1 Well  I'm sorry 
label2 No  hang on  hang on 
label1 Uh  fine  FYI  secret-keeping ? Hate it  Hand-holding ? Not a fan  Hammerhead shark ? I love that thing  Yeah  it's another fish with a tool on its head 
label1 Amy had a fight  I was being perfectly reasonable  I'm gonna have a whiskey  Do you want anything ?
label1 That is a snowy tree cricket  Oecanthus fultoni  I was done with Latin by fifth grade 
label1 Aquaman ? Oh  this isn't a gag gift  Stuart 
label2 You need to let it go  Sheldon 
label2 Why not ?
label2 Do not adjust the dosage  You nailed it 
label1 Blonde women  huh ?
label2 Has it ever worked ?
label2 I did like that he had the weather on it 
label1 You know what would be nice ?
label1 You're right  I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you  He played ! He played ! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again  He was okay with that nickname 
label1 They're not supposed to  but they should 
label1 Bert did quality research  and he deserves whatever accolades he receives 
label2 Oh  I hope they let us in soon  I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom  The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time  It's a vicious circle 
label1 Mm  If it makes you feel any better  a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction 
label2 It's important you know how much you mean to us 
label2 Thank-you  We'll be right back 
label1 Okay  you got it  See  I was afraid it was a thinker 
label1 All right  I'll give you that one 
label1 Not with a bowling ball on their back 
label2 Yeah  You ought to come out with us sometime 
label2 Well  I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike 
label1 Nonsense  I look like a train conductor  Under what pretext did you lure her here ?
label1 Uh-huh  Interesting  Okay 
label2 No  it's not  Always made it worse 
label1 No  I thought we were friends  You asked for a sip of my Icee  If you had your own straw  I might've said yes 
label1 Well  in that case  try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you 
label1 Oh  All right  I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex 
label2 See ? Now  that's the great thing  We're out as friends  This is not a date  Sex is off the table  So  let's go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is  Sorry  Spoiler alert 
label1 Can you believe my mother thinks we're both strange ?
label1 It's five and a half 
label2 Let it go  Sheldon  the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not 
label1 Section 74  C  The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot 
label2 Well  he's not wrong  Howard did go to the International Space Station 
label2 I  I didn't want to interrupt 
label2 Look  it's you 
label1 Is that a dog ?
label1 What stimulus should we introduce it to first ? Light  sound  temperature  oh  oh  let's
label2 I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do 
label1 Well  I've been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn't make protons decay  I'm hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment  See  I've got  uh  my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature  Uh  I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty  And then  oh  last but not least  this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman 
label2 Yeah  thank you 
label1 Flash-frozen brown rice  not white ?
label2 Sure  sure  Uh  when will Stuart be back ?
label2 Yes  but it's okay  Now that we know what the problem is  there's a simple solution 
label2 Then what was oh  boy ?
label2 Sheldon took our order 
label1 You know  Leonard and I were very happy before you came along 
label1 Oh  foolish Wil Wheaton  it was never off 
label2 Oh  uh  he's crazy 
label1 Excuse me  I have to break up with my girlfriend 
label1 Penny ?
label1 That's it  I'm down to seven friends 
label1 Harsh terms  But all right  I'll just substitute intercourse 
label1 On a scale of one to ten  where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off 
label2 No reason  I'm just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something 
label2 Why not ? People do things right now all the time  Why can't we be right now people too  Go home  pack a bag and we'll be right now people  I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription  but after that we'll go right now 
label1 Did Leonard ? I'm no expert  but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm 
label1 Gentlemen  we need to stop immediately 
label1 Ooh  that sounds fun  Now  we're talking about real treats  right ? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me 
label1 She's in my spot  Don't look at me like that  everybody knows that my spot 
label1 You may want to put on slacks 
label2 Wil  I'm begging you  just please turn that off 
label1 Well  who would ever guess that ?
label1 Wherever the music takes me  kitten  I play bongos walking down the stairs 
label1 It certainly looks okay  Has a strong toxic chemical smell  That's reassuring 
label1 Yes  but he's going to a better place where he won't get beat up  So much 
label2 Aaaah ! I  you  how can  what !
label2 I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment 
label2 I don't think so 
label2 Elizabeth ? What's going on ?
label1 They did 
label1 All right 
label1 Uh  peace out !
label2 I didn't do it for the money !
label1 Oh  of course 
label1 Shame on you  Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude ? I'll tell you  We would have the standard and the miniature poodle  but no toy or teacup  Which by the way  is not an officially recognized breed  but that's just poodle politics 
label1 All right  that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening  Who's ready to play some vintage video games ? And tonight's selections include ColecoVision's Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle  Atari's Cookie Monster Munch  and for you text adventure aficionados  Zork  Pick me  pick me  I'm fun 
label2 It was pretty cool 
label2 Here you are  Mother 
label2 Are you insane ? I'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment 
label2 This was Feynman's van ? That's so cool 
label2 Okay  is everyone clear on the plan ?
label2 So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit ?
label1 So  why is it no longer a specialty ? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself ? And look over here  shrimp in mobster sauce  What is mobster sauce ?
label1 Interesting  Do you recall this conversation ? Leonard  want to go halfsies on a steamer ? No  Sheldon  we don't need a steamer  Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost 
label1 Oh  I haven't asked it yet 
label2 That's enough cardio for me  I'm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights 
label2 Ah  no kidding ! A Fu Man Chu ? A handlebar pencil ?
label2 I can try  but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it 
label1 That's pretty funny  that does sound like me  But that doesn't mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along 
label1 Why would I touch her  she's covered with airplane germs 
label2 I'd still like to know who Jerry is 
label1 Only nine more months to comic-con 
label1 Fine ! Smoot-Cooper  Wow  what a diva 
label1 Hold on  I see what's wrong here  We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe  not to the prefrontal cortex 
label1 Couple of questions about the plaque 
label1 Well  now do you see the problem ?
label2 Well  one of them is 
label2 It's not our fault  Our dads never did anything like this with us 
label2 That's pretty cool 
label2 Come on  you're trying to have sex with your father  and I'm okay with that 
label1 He's not gonna make it 
label2 Sheldon  we can't let him drive 
label1 Get ? Hang on  I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously 
label1 But we start talking about a table  and suddenly we're at each other's throats 
label1 My apologies  I chose my words poorly  I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch  Anyway  thank you for watching it  It's one of my all-time favourites 
label1 Your failed attempt to go back to college ?
label1 Au contraire  When I correct people I am raising them up  You should know  I do it for you more than anyone 
label1 Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist 
label2 What is wrong with you ?
label1 You're just repeating what I said  It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot 
label2 Good-bye  Sheldon 
label1 Although  Amy and I did just move in together  and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift 
label1 Ugh  Atlantic City without the taffy ? No  thank you 
label2 Just when I thought you couldn't get any hotter 
label1 Hey  if you want me to sleep you're gonna have to stop talking 
label1 I must say  Amy  pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction 
label2 Then yeah 
label1 And what is that supposed to mean ?
label2 Why would I lie ?
label1 To burying the hatchet 
label1 Wolowitz ?
label2 Sheldon  I need to talk to you 
label2 Holy crap  are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ?
label2 That's great  but I ' 
label1 Do you think he's right ? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven ?
label1 Well  what exactly do you mean by embarrass you ?
label1 Please tell me you're not having coitus 
label1 They lie so they don't look petty 
label1 He's engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum  It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result  and I do not appreciate it 
label2 Are you saying you want to get married ?
label1 When one gets beaten up every other day in school  one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing  Incidentally  one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one  I'm making English muffins  Would you like an English muffin ?
label2 I am  I'm really proud 
label2 nard : Oh  this just might be your lucky day 
label2 That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes 
label2 Well  the last three nights I've had to take him to get a haircut  to the train store  and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen  Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone 
label1 You didn't mention Leonard 
label1 You're in trouble 
label2 No  I mean  why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz ?
label1 Aren't you going to check your messages ?
label2 Well  just don't get anything Jurassic  He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood  Hey  uh  you know  he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party 
label2 It was us  We knocked over a lamp 
label2 Oh  hey  You work the lunch shift ?
label1 We don't  This is a disturbing aberration 
label1 Yes  Now  when the robots rise up  they'll know that I've been rooting for them the whole time 
label1 Bye  Oh  good news  gentlemen  Amy's at a conference this weekend  which means I'm available to be entertained  hmm  As today's youth might put it  who wants to get their Sheld-on ?
label1 Great  Great  So  what's new with your family ? How's your mother ? Is she alive ?
label1 You're so cute  I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts 
label1 No  I can't  This isn't right 
label2 What  you mean  like  your massive credit card debt ?
label2 Hang on 
label2 Sheldon 
label1 Interesting fact  in Italian  the morta in mortadella means death 
label2 Who's miserable and alone ?
label1 Do people know about her ? ' Cause she's delightful 
label1 And I'm sorry  But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated  We are no longer friends 
label2 Is there a history of heart disease in your family ?
label2 Whatever you recommend 
label2 I usually don't like lemon bars  but these  these are really good 
label2 Well  what are you going to do  Sheldon  give up ?
label1 I knew it 
label2 How would I be blinded ?
label1 Yes  but  he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again 
label1 Well  thank you  And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car  I can't have syrupy fingers  but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl 
label1 If I am permitted to speak again  Dr  Sheldon Cooper for the win 
label1 Do you know  it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees  Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out 
label1 Simple  If she were to log on to
label2 Go away 
label1 My Mee-Maw must never know of this  Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper ?
label1 I'll walk you through it  The game is not called Words with Strangers  No  it's not even called Words with Acquaintances  It is called Words with '
label1 If he understands that  you're in trouble 
label1 I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin  Gentlemen 
label2 Absolutely  You're the girl  I'm the guy  Now  you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here 
label1 You know how I know we're not in The Matrix ?
label1 I'm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you  Let me try again  Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own ? Nudge  nudge  wink  wink 
label1 Penny  if you wouldn't mind  I'd like to have a conversation about girls 
label1 Mmm  all right  It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence  Good night  Please note  it is now past ten p  m  Per our roommate agreement  kindly refrain from raucous laughter  clinking of glasses  and celebratory gunfire 
label2 It's too late for me  My head is her summer house 
label1 Look  it's the same smile she has in the painting 
label1 I had not considered that 
label1 Very well  And good luck  I'm a pretty laid-back guy 
label1 Well  right now  Penny's imagination is running wild  but if they meet  that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears  Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch 
label2 Yeah  it's a regular Manhattan Project  What's up ?
label2 Unbelievable  Okay  uh  I don't know what he told you  but you can't stay here 
label2 Mm-hmm  and what's it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband's stuff ?
label2 You know  never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining 
label1 Nice try  Now  in 1964  Dr  Peter Higgs  accomplished self-promoter and physicist  he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson  Now  initially the paper was rejected  but recently  he was proven right  and now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize 
label2 Penny got it 
label1 This is money I'm not using 
label2 You're making fun of me  Forget it 
label2 Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain 
label1 If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats  then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion 
label1 Oh  no  you know  I'm not really the holding kind of Oh !
label1 I want you to check before you accept the order 
label1 So you're saying this is a regulation deck ?
label1 You can't do that  if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint 
label1 What  now  do you have company ?
label2 Really ? Silence ?
label2 I was hoping we could talk about the money again 
label1 You know  I am very disappointed that I won't be able to celebrate Howard's accomplishment tonight 
label1 Excuse me  Stuart  Have you read the new Flash ?
label2 What is there to explain  it's all right here  it's a betrayal 
label2 Should we call Howard and Bernadette ?
label2 I'm telling you  you got this 
label2 We'd still get in  but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair 
label2 Oh  hey  babe  I think I figured this thing out 
label2 What does that mean ?
label2 You okay ? You seem a little distracted 
label1 Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again 
label1 Okay  well  it was pleasant seeing you  other than that business with my testicles 
label1 I'm sorry  but could you be more specific ?
label1 And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition 
label2 Penny  just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos  Stuart's a terrific artist  He went to the Rhode Island School of Design 
label2 I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut 
label2 Not yet 
label1 I know  Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show ?
label1 Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you  it's a laborious activity  because I have to imagine what you need  whereas you know what you need  Now I can simplify things  just give you the fifty dollars directly and  you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday  and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer  And I ask you  is it worth it ?
label1 I don't think you're taking this seriously 
label1 I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups  I cannot speak to large crowds 
label2 I'm okay 
label2 Okay  when you say make the best of it 
label1 The Web site's frozen  I can't get in 
label1 No  Wait  I want to guess  Don't tell me 
label2 I don't know  Foreplay ?
label1 Apparently  perfect attendance isn't cool any more 
label1 Oh  I guess you're just friends with anybody 
label1 Tubs are slippery 
label1 Well alright then 
label1 Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded ?
label1 Good evening  Leonard  Howard  Raj  freeloader 
label1 But I met with 11 people  and they all walked out  And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back 
label1 Yes  please 
label2 You have a girlfriend ? How could you have a girlfriend ? You can't even speak to women 
label1 It's like it was yesterday 
label2 Are you sure ?
label1 I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you  but to elaborate  I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard  Wolowitz and Koothrappali 
label1 It's totally understandable  In bladder voiding  as in real estate  it's location  location  location 
label2 Of course I'm going to do something  Uh  Howard  you check the comic book store  Raj  go to the Thai restaurant  I'll stay here with Penny in her apartment 
label1 And now you're gone  too  It's like all the men I've looked up to have gone away 
label1 I assumed you would 
label2 Why don't you enlighten me ?
label2 There's a security camera ?
label2 nard : Okay  I suppose I could drive you  Well that's a point in my favour  right ?
label1 Tonight is Halo night  it's like talking to a wall 
label1 Very well done 
label2 I don't know what that means 
label2 Fine  if you apologize to everyone  they all say it's okay  then yes  you can come 
label1 Rajesh  I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years  My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs 
label2 Oh  we have to use the stairs 
label1 Two for two  I'm on fire 
label1 Hmm  No  not yet 
label2 I took a little lady I like to call loneliness 
label2 Oh  I guess I was hoping for a different reaction  but okay 
label2 They're running a little behind  Should be pretty soon 
label2 No  it's no big deal  it's just the way I was raised  My parents focussed on celebrating achievements  and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them 
label2 Thank you  I should probably give you a heads up about his mother 
label1 Very well  but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics  you're going to have to answer to my mother 
label2 You think ?
label2 Me neither  Oh  Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him  But I just want you to know it's fine 
label2 It's not crazy 
label1 Yeah  well  of course I am  I was also right about her hair  It did everything but quack 
label2 Oh  well  then you'll enjoy this  Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali 
label2 I don't know what to tell you  Sheldon  I'm going to see Priya  Everyone's over there  You coming or not ?
label2 I answered every question Sheldon 
label1 Did you once again ignore your check engine light ?
label2 Well  no  not socially  But  you know  just at work 
label1 Because  despite his fame and fortune  he strikes me as a lonely man 
label1 You're right  it can wait until morning 
label1 Why are you crying ?
label1 I hope laughter is the best medicine  ' cause this care package is a joke 
label1 I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being 
label1 No  no  Let me do the math for you  this car weighs let's say 4000 lb  now add say 140 for me  120 for you 
label1 But why are you here ?
label2 I'll be there as soon as I can 
label1 Wait  that purple flag indicates that marine pests  such as jellyfish  are present 
label2 Bye Missy  see you 
label1 Okay  literal goose bumps  Look 
label2 Once again  I'm driving  I'm right here 
label1 Counter-proposal  We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum  in the spirit of Mother's Day or Father's Day  once a year  we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life  both actual and imagined by you  We could call it Leonard's Day 
label1 Uh  you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track ?
label1 Well of course they're movies  Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine ? That's absurd 
label2 Okay  Star Trek  the original series  the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds  Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same 
label2 Yep  it is 
label1 Well  they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months  If so  the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop 
label2 Hey  Stuart  have you seen Sheldon ?
label1 Oh  but I am  Didn't Penny tell you the good news ?
label1 I understand  You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top 
label1 All right  I'll try 
label2 I'm going out for a while 
label2 Aw  see  yeah  you probably shouldn't have done that  So write another e-mail  set the record straight  it's no big deal 
label1 There's a speaker box  Drive up  push the button  and let's see what happens 
label2 That sounds fun 
label1 It's too late for Koothrappali  Let's go 
label2 Please don't be mad 
label2 You can't be serious  ' Cause I messed up and made out with a girl  you're gonna do the same with a random guy ?
label1 When I signed for the package  I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery  I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable 
label1 Well  you-sa can go think that at the back of the line  No cuts  no buts  no coconuts 
label2 Right  right  So you're still just texting and emailing ? You don't feel any need to hang out with her  you know  be in the same room ?
label2 Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag  Oh  no 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Stephen Hawking hates me 
label2 Fine  whatever  Priya will be having breakfast 
label1 Did you know that  Leonard ?
label2 Yeah  well  before they went out of business  I bought 4000 containers  I keep them in the trunk of my car 
label2 You don't have to  Ever 
label1 I'm sorry  if you didn't cheer at my entrance  it's too late to buy into the premise  Anyway  I got some extra money from the head of the department  and raj can come work for me 
label2 Sheldon !
label1 And here is my Justice League membership card  But that doesn't prove I know Batman 
label2 And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor 
label2 Okay  Bye-bye ! What are you looking at ? You've never seen a hypocrite before ?
label2 Oh  just  you know  moving a ' time machine 
label2 Oshikuru : Demon Samurai 
label2 Guava ?
label2 Got it  So  can I see you again ?
label2 No  no  no  Hang on  I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold 
label1 Not now  Penny  this poor man needs me 
label1 Hey  fellas  I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some 
label1 Now  if you'll excuse me  I'm off to buy a pussycat 
label2 Not yet  but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away 
label1 I know  As I'm sure you're aware '
label1 Captain  I'm getting an unusual reading 
label1 They're right  it was the only option 
label2 Well  we're  we're very happy for you 
label1 Oh  no 
label1 How does that work ?
label1 Okay  now  the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking 
label1 Penny would be the entree  Then Leonard's basically a cheese course  And because I love you  you're dessert 
label1 I believe I can answer that 
label1 My good sir  we are neither crackpots nor wannabes  In fact  we are experts in our fields  And while you hide behind your anonymity  we stand behind our paper  And later tonight  your mother 
label2 No  thank you  I'm really not much of a dancer 
label2 That was a huge spoiler 
label1 No  Despite what the name suggests  the civet cat is not a true cat  Now I'm done 
label1 What is your problem ?
label1 Alright ?
label2 SNIPE !
label1 If I make this move  but I won't because we're having too much fun 
label1 That's not an apology  simply an acknowledgement that I was right 
label1 I'm not going to bother him  I'm going to talk to him 
label2 That is not what I said 
label2 Now  Raj  kill Sheldon 
label2 Sorry  palm's a little sweaty  What's that word ?
label1 I think you're high on paint fumes  And boy  that's a lot of Band-Aids 
label2 You don't need air bags 
label2 Go away 
label1 No  we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton 
label2 Ah  so like every other M  Night Shyamalan movie I've seen  you spoil it in advance 
label2 Hey  where you been ?
label2 You know  I was thinking  there are some great research facilities in India 
label1 Oh  right  yes  I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian  Arabic and Farsi  Why can't she get her own TV 
label2 Hey  you got a minute ?
label1 The water level rose 
label2 No  Maybe to her 
label1 I'll have the chicken noodle  Goodnight 
label1 All right 
label2 No  wait ! If anyone asks you where I went  you don't know 
label1 Fine  Candy bars  Now  do you enjoy a fun size ? I know you do 
label1 Why would that make me feel better ?
label1 No  no  No  I learned my lesson  I understand that was inappropriate 
label1 Enjoy the accolades now  Wil Wheaton  but like your time on Star Trek : Next Generation  your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived 
label2 Thank you 
label1 Well  Leonard  I think it's high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room 
label1 It's late  Got to go  Bye 
label2 Okay  the X10s are online 
label1 Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy ?
label2 Why don't you just eat in your desk chair ?
label2 Any other questions ?
label1 Yes  I did  And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest 
label1 Oh great  see you at seven 
label1 Oh  that wasn't clear  Try it again  but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples  Missy ?
label2 What  who told you that ?
label2 No  no-no-no  I'm ready ! I gave up the gift of sight for you  If that's not moving on  what is ?
label1 Precisely  I didn't do anything  Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math ?
label2 Are you kidding ? Yes  What did you have in mind ?
label2 Uh-huh  The viewing area's right over there  Sheldon  your girl ' date ' person ' Ramona's here 
label2 Penny  have you seen my good inhaler ?
label1 Sheldon is not going 
label2 I'm doing okay  I guess 
label2 C'mon now  throw one 
label2 I know  but you're going to be a TV star and you haven't left me yet  That takes guts 
label2 kay  Leonard : Cool 
label1 One at a time 
label1 I can't do that  What if he serves haggis and blood pudding ?
label2 If we do  I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy 
label2 Is your tongue blue ?
label2 You can have my car 
label1 Come in 
label1 Wait  a question  who decides if someone's gone off topic ?
label1 Amy's right  He is tedious 
label1 Quick  what does a hawk sound like ?
label2 You could have waited until morning  I know  look who I'm talking to 
label1 Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women 
label2 Yeah  that's a real pickle  Bye 
label1 We're not friends at the moment  Depends on how this goes 
label1 Well  there's no point in dwelling on it  As the Vulcans say  Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish Du stau 
label1 Illogical  Oh  damn it Spock  you're right  I'll do it 
label2 nard : Oh  good  I passed the barriers 
label1 Well  it's your word against mine ; see you in court 
label1 Unlikely  That's a television show  Leonard 
label1 And I'm happy for you  too  You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking  Enjoy it  boys  You may have peaked 
label1 Well  if you want romance  then let's have romance  Oh  look  there's wine  Mmm  Grape juice that burns  Uh  now let's gaze into each other's eyes  hmm ? You blinked  I win 
label1 Oh  smashing  Now  Leonard  do you know how to get there ?
label1 What  are you sure ? It's my first prom  I want to do it correctly 
label2 Hang on  I know I don't possess the tools of leadership  but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside 
label1 Are you sure ? Every time my dad stayed out all night  my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco 
label2 Come on  Penny 
label1 That's my boy 
label1 Not finished  It is because of you that I now have a criminal record  and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee 
label1 I can't 
label2 I've been thinking about it  and you might be right  But the good news is that I'm pretty sure I know why 
label2 You have a new job 
label1 Oh  dear 
label1 It's a conversation starter 
label1 Look  a side door  Come on  Short Round 
label1 Leonard's asleep 
label2 No  I have to go pick him up  Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place 
label2 Your company ?
label1 Bazinga ! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming  do you ?
label1 Alright  let me put it this way  Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $ 3000 for one night's work 
label2 Oh  Yeah  okay 
label2 Okay fine  I'm  I'm a horrible human being  I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena 
label2 Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars turned into hot dog stands ?
label2 nard : Uh  I'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge 
label2 Yeah  I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2 : Monkey See  Monkey Kill  You know  it's still possible for you to be good in a bad movie 
label2 Uh  oh  gee  my initial reaction is no  You know  let me think about it and get back to you  okay ?
label1 I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics 
label1 En garde  Leonard  Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching 
label2 Still  I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and ' you know ' move on with my life 
label2 Not bad  I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would 
label1 Stop it !
label1 I told you  she made spaghetti with little hot dogs  I like spaghetti with little hot dogs 
label2 I'll set the timer 
label2 Really ? Triumphant ?
label1 But why should that keep me up ?
label1 Raj  now  I'm sorry you're suffering  When Amy and I were broken up  I also suffered  And this may sound surprising  but I'm grateful for having gone through it 
label2 This is ridiculous  I'm going across the hall 
label1 I see  You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's unwinnable command scenario  the Kobayashi Maru 
label2 And who got him to try a turkey dog ?
label2 No  no  say it  Sing it  Rent a plane  write it in the sky 
label2 Um  not great  I guess  But Penny and I are just friends 
label1 Oh  You got even smaller  I love it  Uh  Meemaw  this is Leonard  Leonard  this is my Meemaw 
label1 Of course you didn't  he said little idea ?
label1 Hey  Raj  I owe you an apology  Look  could you please put your dog on a leash ?
label2 I got you the lamb kabob 
label1 Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is ?
label2 I'm putting the city names in the grid now  I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe 
label1 Good night 
label1 I'm okay  How was the funeral ?
label2 Some things are more important than toys 
label1 My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead 
label2 Wow  you remember that ?
label2 I can vouch for that 
label1 Why would you do that ?
label1 Oh  well  then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me  Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me  All right  this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt 
label1 I need eggs  Four dozen should suffice 
label1 In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm  and yet not so close as to cause perspiration  In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there  and there  It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct  thus discouraging conversation  nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion  I could go on  but I think I've made my point 
label1 You made God sad today  Mom 
label2 Sheldon 
label1 ' playing Klingon Boggle 
label1 Your doom !
label1 Agreed 
label1 No  This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole 
label1 No  to wake up every morning and know you're there is a great comfort to me  Mmm  tasteless  How do you do it ?
label2 How many times are you gonna tell me ? What's with you ?
label2 You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor ?
label2 Nevertheless  I'd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did 
label2 Oh ! I didn't even think of that  Thanks 
label2 Excellent 
label1 Well  what passes for science on dating sites  They claim to use heuristic algorithms  but it may well be hokum 
label2 You want some of this ? I'll give you some 
label1 Oh  oh  red light  release accelerator and slowly apply the brake  Nailed it  While we have a moment  may I ask you a question ?
label1 No  it's yucky  but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy  yum-yum 
label2 I wanted to tell you in the car  but you told me to stop talking
label1 How could there be a double blind study  who would be the control group 
label2 Afraid so  Skippy 
label2 No  don't do that 
label1 If only Penny had said that once in a while 
label2 Really ?
label2 Great  What are you going to do first ?
label2 Saloons ?
label1 Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home 
label2 Thank you 
label2 This should be fun 
label2 Hi Penny 
label1 Why is there a hole in my new office ? I've narrowed it down to two possibilities : There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted  or the more disturbing  there was something in the wall that wanted out 
label2 That was fast 
label2 No  but you can have mine 
label1 Excuse me  May I have your attention  please ? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip  And I just want to say  shame on all of you  We're scientists  Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge  not the intimate details of other people's lives 
label1 Oh ! I see the confusion here  No  no  Alex thought I was singling her out  No  I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges  you know ? Even you  You're a slave 
label1 Fine  we'll abide by the Geneva Convention  But ask yourself this  in the course of our lives  how much lunch money has been taken from us ? How many kites ? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers ?
label2 You want to breed a new friend ?
label2 It's a '
label2 Just not against their will 
label1 No  but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish  that's on you  All right  Oh  and lastly  please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen  In which case  all glory to the hive queen  All right  now all that's left is for us to sign and date the document  and we will officially no longer be roommates 
label1 Thank you  Jesus ! As my mother would say 
label2 Uh  before you open that  um  are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves ?
label2 I know what you're doing  You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you  but it's not happening 
label2 Golden Dragon 
label2 Fine  take the plant 
label1 He's an odd duck  isn't he ?
label1 The TV is gone 
label2 I know  but when I shop online  I can do it on the toilet 
label1 Leonard  I'm dying 
label1 I wouldn't say amazing  At best  it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree 
label1 If ifs and buts were candy and nuts  we'd all have a merry Christmas  Think about that  Dr  Tyson 
label2 Howard  you talk to him  Howard ? You're peeing  aren't you ?
label1 Richard Feynman played the bongos  I thought I'd give that a try 
label1 Well  you know  I've always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur  about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad  And that ring was inscribed with the phrase  this too shall pass 
label1 Because of the two additional Ethernet ports 
label2 This conference is kind of a big thing  The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot 
label2 A lackey ?
label2 But it's an expression of our love 
label1 Well  the Germans have always been a comforting people  Just remember  Leonard  where your biological family has failed you  you always have me  your surrogate family 
label1 Well  I would have been here sooner  but for some reason your home isn't on this map of Hollywood stars 
label1 Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation  This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland  the product of decades of planning and construction  It is a Mecca for physicists the world over  This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard  They sell scented soaps and lotions  some of which contain glitter  Now  let's see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination 
label1 My bad  I did send a gift from both of us 
label1 I'm fine 
label1 You ripped out your own fake blonde hair 
label2 I'm sorry  so you never went outside ?
label2 We're home 
label1 If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent  she's being patently absurd 
label1 Well  clearly  it's not whatever I want  because what I want is for you to make this decision  and you refuse to do that 
label2 You can do this 
label1 God  no 
label1 Here come the waterworks 
label1 That depends 
label2 Alright  alright  Boy  we are learning a lot here  huh ? Thank you  astronaut Howard  Um  I am what's called an experimental physicist  which is super-fun  because I get to test theories and work with lasers  Yes ?
label1 Who leaves their bike in the hallway ? You know  if I knew how to ride one  I'd steal it 
label2 Fine  I'll take him for shoes next Saturday 
label2 He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition 
label1 Or you might think she thinks you think it's a date even though she doesn't 
label1 Well  get ready to stroll down memory lane  Penny  your check engine '
label1 No  no  I understand  Anything happened to my mee-maw  I'd be one inconsolable moon pie  I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie 
label1 How many women have you had dates with ?
label2 Oh  Alright uh ' enjoy the rest of your evening 
label2 I'd enjoy that 
label2 What's up with the infrared cameras ?
label1 How does one sort of '
label2 Here we go 
label2 On our Quidditch team  he '
label2 Do you really think there's gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it ?
label2 Just relax  it's a joke  You don't have hormones 
label2 So I did something stupid  I'm sure you did stupid things when you were younger  What were you doing seven years ago ?
label1 True  Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log  entry one  Koothrappali's restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves 
label1 Oh  I have a solution  first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device 
label1 All right  Boone  North Carolina  Every summer since 1952  Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake  Dan'l Boone  Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd  Penny  you're from Nebraska  correct ?
label2 I wonder a lot of things about you  Sheldon  but not ' not that 
label2 Thank you 
label1 I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer  Frisch  Panofsky  Feynman  Weisskopf '
label1 Yes  Like we're on a ship  Coming from Africa to America 
label2 I can't believe you kept this 
label2 What about loop quantum gravity ?
label1 Oh  sure  And while we're at it  why don't we put our hands behind our backs  have an old-fashioned eating contest ?
label1 He's right  And given that you're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade  I'm sure you do suck 
label2 Double potion  please 
label1 Hello  So I guess you're really holding up the other four fingers ?
label1 Raj's television  I just realized we're about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner 
label2 Guys  it's stolen  It should go back to Peter Jackson  He made the movies  it belongs to him 
label2 Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine 
label1 You really need to work on your penmanship 
label1 Then I've been up all night 
label2 Waah  I don't want a table 
label1 Oh  stop  And I believe this is yours  FYI  if you wear that into a bank  they will tackle you to the ground 
label2 Look  everything went fine  I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters  The woman across the hall is into me 
label2 Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle 
label1 Those are very wise words 
label2 Penny  just  wait  I've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night 
label2 That's the spirit 
label1 What is it about the word unique you don't understand ?
label1 The dragon's Christopher Walken  That's perfect 
label2 Oh  my God  you're jealous 
label1 Oh  yes  Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas  Cats  however  refuse to wear sporting apparel  My sister found that out the hard way 
label1 Well  it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting ' How wasted am I ? which is met with an approving chorus of ' Dude  '
label2 No  just sit here 
label1 You see  Penny  the Israelites were in the desert '
label1 Hunger ? Indigestion  I'm sorry I'm really not very good at this  Anyway  Penny now believes that on Friday night  we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention 
label1 Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on 
label1 The zoot suit riots 
label2 Well  we did it 
label1 And you'll text me when you arrive at the airport ?
label1 This table  it's in square centimetres  I read it as square metres  You know what that means ?
label1 What reference ?
label1 Not surprising  Penny's emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala  while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex  The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless 
label2 Why not 
label1 Oh  it's not your fault  I've been to the model train store  I've been to Radio Shack  This woman is impossible to shop for 
label2 Men do things for women without expecting sex 
label2 To the bedroom 
label1 Okay  now you're getting creative 
label1 Let's see  What's next ? Oh  kissing's romantic 
label1 Uh-duh  hold on  hold on !
label2 And then the  the subject got changed somehow 
label1 Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company  it's actually extremely plausible 
label2 Why is it odd ?
label1 Give me one good reason why not 
label2 From her micro-husband  That is amazing  How long did this take you ?
label2 It'll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives 
label2 It's kind of a fashionable look these days 
label1 Penny for your thoughts 
label1 I've been cooped up in here too long  Maybe I need some fresh air 
label2 Wait  are we really going to Long Beach ?
label2 Well  then let's un-pause it 
label1 You're sitting in my spot 
label2 Yes ! For God's sake  Sheldon  do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth 
label1 Interrupting physicist 
label2 Sheldon ! it's an amazing coincidence  can we leave it at that ?
label1 Right  games  They took Halo 1  Halo 2  Halo 3  Call of Duty 1  Call of Duty 2  Call of Duty 3  Rock Band  Rock Band 2  Final Fantasy 1 thru 9  The Legend of Zelda  The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time  The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess  Super Mario Brothers  Super Mario Galaxy  Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms  Pacman 
label1 Perhaps two  I'd like to master the craft 
label2 I don't know about this  Howard 
label1 Yes  well it's better than what Wolowitz did  He drew a raccoon with what appears to be  a distended scrotum 
label2 You can't let her get into your head 
label1 Okay  But I think it could have ended with the karaoke 
label2 What ? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don't know about ?
label1 Or in German  a Besserwisser 
label1 It's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder  We discussed it at length during our last video chat  Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling 
label2 Tushy face  that is going on Twitter right now 
label1 No  you can't use that one  That's mine  Uh  try this one for an ice-breaker  Uh  despite popular lore  there is no place in the continental United States  Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China 
label1 Interesting  You're suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it 
label1 Hmm  Do you like Raisinets ?
label1 Well  Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters  so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival 
label2 Sheldon ?
label1 Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend 
label2 The robot didn't hurt his feelings 
label2 And what would I have said afterwards ?
label1 For science  maybe you should 
label1 I'm not unhappy 
label2 Where did you get that ?
label1 Fine  As you know  I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday  Every year we'd have a party  No one I invited would ever come  because they didn't like me 
label1 Dear Lord ! Have you been drinking it ?
label1 Well  you really want to dot the I's and cross the T's  don't you ?
label1 Now  this side offers me proximity to the bathroom  but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep 
label1 For goodness sake  he's wearing a hat  glasses  and a red striped shirt 
label1 I'm in hell  Leonard  Don't stop 
label1 How ? You had the whole floor to yourself 
label2 Terrific  but that kind of raises more questions than it answers 
label2 Well  yeah  one of us has to keep an open mind 
label1 Ah  normally I refrain from alcohol  but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs  why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus ?
label1 Of course you are  I'm warm and soothing  I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup 
label2 So anyway  that's great news about you and Bernadette 
label2 Doesn't sound that bad 
label2 What's your problem ?
label1 You're welcome  Leonard 
label1 Oh  yes ? Well  before I respond  let me ask you a question  Is your mother a good or poor bowler ?
label1 It's about streetcars ? Oh  great  I won't need this 
label2 The new Star Wars movie 
label1 Oh ! No  I beg to differ  Of the three of us  I was by far the most supportive 
label2 Yup  just want to get married 
label1 Are you sure ? You look a bit puffy 
label1 Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover ?
label2 No  you don't  But let's say you do  And don't say you do  because you don't  Now  wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it ?
label2 Some sports bar  It's like they never even heard of Quidditch  Do we really have to go ?
label2 Sure  What's up ?
label1 You tell me  I feel like I can't breathe  and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs 
label2 A Slim Jim ?
label1 I'm sneaking into work  Now  if the guard at the university asks what's under the blanket  you tell him it's some lobster traps 
label2 Listen  Sheldon  this is stupid  I don't see why we can't be friends  And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff  I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement 
label2 Alright  please don't cheer me up anymore 
label1 Well  I'm responding to it 
label2 I'm glad you enjoyed it  Most people aren't that interested in what I do 
label1 For the record  I do have genitals  They're functional and aesthetically pleasing 
label2 Uh-huh  Seriously  six months ?
label2 What ? Hey  hey ! Come back here !
label2 Okay  fine  we'll just play one on one until he gets back 
label1 Boy  some people are just glass-half-empty 
label2 Why ? Because they won't get off your lawn ? Is Stuart trying to get a loan  or  or find investors ?
label2 Our gaming room  I was gonna put a scented candle in it 
label2 Oh  yeah 
label1 Oh  of course  come in 
label2 You think ?
label2 Here you go 
label2 Yeah  it's delicious  the sarcasm's a little stale  though  Hey  how about this ? Until we figure out what to do with the ring  Penny holds on to it 
label2 Knowing Sheldon  nothing 
label2 Well  that's it  That's the end of Roger Abbott 
label1 A group of cats is a clowder  Or a glaring 
label2 Raj  no  it's a trap  they're flanking us !
label2 Oh  How's it going ?
label1 What time did you tell Amy to be here ?
label1 Well  cell service is down to one bar  so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid  now's the time 
label2 I mostly just smell my nasal spray 
label2 What brought that on ?
label2 Great  So how'd it go with Stuart last night ?
label1 Not entirely  the fight over who's going to drive is still '
label1 Hello  dear friends  And Dr  Hofstadter 
label1 What took you so long ?
label2 Well  it's not really a great time  Penny and I have some things we need to talk about 
label1 He will  he's really smart 
label2 Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet ?
label1 Oh  that makes sense  ' cause she's gone and you miss her 
label1 You have to check your messages  the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message  If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy 
label2 That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap 
label1 That can't be nothing  the check engine light is on  We need to find a service station 
label2 That's alright  my tail's prehensile  I'll swat him off 
label1 I see  And is that why everybody was invited but me ?
label2 If you don't come out of there  I'm going to have to drag you out 
label2 Oh  hey  You guys didn't break up 
label1 Well  why isn't everyone happy ? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again 
label1 Am I ? Let me tell you a story 
label2 Are we playing individual or teams ?
label1 Dr  Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged  This is our friend Penny's place  You may remember her from our episode  Flags and the People Who Don't Understand Them 
label1 Look on the bright side  As the result of Penny's forfeit  you have become the world's first winner of Research Lab  Would you like a commemorative snow cone ?
label1 Thank you  Lift with your knees  not your back  Good night 
label2 Stop it  you're gonna make me cry  All right  You seem pretty confident 
label1 I see  Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness ?
label1 Oh  and we're going to use props ?
label2 Oh  I took care of it 
label1 Yeah  Call first 
label1 Unhand me  This is ridiculous 
label1 I think I'll eat my lunch at home 
label2 Penny  wait 
label1 Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton ?
label2 Well  honey  not to complain  but we were starting to think you didn't either 
label2 Sorry  Officer 
label1 You're right  That was uncalled for  I take it back 
label2 Excuse me ?
label2 Sheldon  I'm gonna get the surgery  it's no big deal  End of story 
label2 Baseball 
label2 Look  I know shopping cheers you up  but it's just not really my thing 
label1 Listen to you  How can I possibly go ?
label2 What is happening there ?
label2 Oh yeah  it is  and you won  I  I  I'm  I'm sorry  I have to go  I don't believe this 
label2 No  but that's okay  I'll go talk to her  Want to come with ?
label1 I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz  but he's so zazzy 
label1 No  That's it  I am calling campus security  You prepare for the scolding of your life 
label2 Yep  You know what ? That was pretty crappy of you  I mean  all I wanted to do was give you a great night  and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it 
label1 Oh  it's like I'm really there 
label1 Good morning  If I could have everyone's attention  please ? I know we're all eager to get on the road to Big Sur  so if we focus  I'm sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour  Then it's just Q & A  quiz  safety drills  pose for commemorative group photo and we're off 
label2 You realize if the military declares our research classified  they can take the whole thing away from us 
label1 Did you notice the sign on his counter ? He's not a full-time dry cleaner  He also makes keys 
label1 Muggles 
label1 Oh  and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish  My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short 
label2 Sorry  buddy 
label2 No  thanks 
label1 While I disagree with the premise of tenure  if they gave it to me  it wouldn't diminish my output  You know  I'm like the sun  Can't turn this off 
label1 I'm sorry  I don't recall you saying no backsies 
label2 Come on  We're gonna have sex  and it's not gonna mean a thing !
label1 Oh  I see  Penny  I'm not sure I'm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation 
label2 I hope she wasn't anything like my flatmate from Texas 
label1 If I'd known you were broke  I wouldn't have made a big deal about the bread 
label2 You know I want to marry you  but you're only doing this because you got fired and you're feeling sorry for yourself 
label2 No offence  but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that's happened today 
label1 You'd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension  Mud 
label1 No  no  comfort is the enemy  You know what's comfortable ? Slippers and blankets and panda bears  Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it  Warm up the car  Leonard  it's poster time 
label1 We just went swimming 
label2 Well  I'd like that  too 
label2 No  it was called for 
label1 Ooh  this is a good one 
label2 Yeah  you know what else it is ?
label2 And I may have hit on her a little bit 
label1 Captain Kirk won 
label1 You can't go out  it's Halo night 
label1 It's not a big deal  We have latex gloves 
label1 And now you're out of life  Why did you hit pause ?
label2 Sheldon  do you see what just happened here ?
label2 Well then start throwing grenades 
label1 I'm not sorry  That's true 
label1 I just had cobbler 
label1 Hi  Stephanie  I'm sorry I'm late  but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation 
label1 Are you sure ? These items represent our shared times together 
label1 No  You're my friend  and  I'm sorry 
label2 They have some board games 
label1 Well  sure 
label2 That is so sweet  In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you how much this means to me 
label2 Thank you 
label1 Well  first of all  your lie was laughably transparent  where mine is exquisitely convoluted  While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web 
label2 Stop it 
label1 And you want me to return it for you ?
label2 So  what do you say ?
label1 Uh  suppose I'll have to find and cultivate a new roommate  What a task that will be  Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in ?
label1 Oh  Dr  and Mrs  Hofstadter  lovely to see you this fine morning 
label2 Oh  how kind of her 
label2 Good day ?
label2 Okay  Well  now that everyone's here  Penny and I have some big news  We're engaged 
label2 No  This is the level I am stooping to  I believe that is flag to crotch four  checkmate  Easy-peasy  ooh  so breezy 
label1 Excuse me  Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek :
label2 nard : I did notify you 
label2 Ah now th-th-there you go  Always made it worse 
label2 What's wrong with a football jersey ?
label1 I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip  and I'm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
label2 Making great time  Gonna be there pretty early 
label2 Doing it right now  Oh  they can't  There's an important Little League game tomorrow 
label1 Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there  Aren't you going to let me out ?
label1 Some people are otters  some people are rocks 
label2 Who's there ?
label1 Well  actually  the risk of throat cutting is very low  On the other hand  severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger 
label1 Leonard ? Leonard ?
label1 All right  I'm no stranger to a little gray matter  Locus coeruleus  Locus coeruleus 
label1 Good thinking  Perhaps I'll check the perimeter and make some warm milk 
label2 They '  might all be there  Or a subset of them might be there  uh  algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns  for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch  sometimes he finds that filling  other times he doesn't  it's no fault of Quizznos  they have a varied menu 
label2 You really are a mean little man 
label1 You know  Italian housewives have a rule of thumb  A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked 
label1 Look at you  getting me to engage in the social sciences  You're a vixen  Amy Farrah Fowler 
label1 You also made a common grammatical mistake  you said nauseous when you meant nauseated  But go on 
label1 Excuse me  in a world that already includes the Big Boy  why would I settle for something like a Big Boy ?
label2 I'll  I'll call for help 
label1 It's like there's a train in your mouth  Howard : Oh  yeah  I've got one  Um  the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago  Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch  bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch  Ooo-ooo 
label1 Thank you for agreeing to see me  Agent Page 
label2 I'm sorry  I didn't hear anything after lick 
label2 Reconstituted Thai food 
label1 Yes  Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody ?
label1 I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas  and you sent this autographed picture back to me  Do you remember that ?
label2 How is super-aging any different than  like  doing crossword puzzles ?
label2 It's anonymous  and user name General Relativity 
label2 I missed you  too 
label2 What ya doing  Skippy ?
label2 Hang on  They're showing a new digital print of Time Bandits  you wouldn't want to come  would you ?
label1 No  it's fine  Now I can devote all my time to dark matter 
label2 A lot of people are working on that research  So what is all this ?
label2 Mmm  My pleasure 
label2 If you must know  Penny won a spa weekend from work  and she's taking me 
label2 Couple of weeks 
label1 Well  that's certainly amusing  but I have no interest 
label2 Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment  Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic 
label2 Fine  Just get back under your blanket  and I'll drive you there 
label1 Action 
label1 I think you should turn on the GPS 
label1 Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed  Mahalo for nothing  Hawaii 
label1 The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent  No offence  Stuart 
label1 All right  why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic 
label2 You may have actually just come up with something 
label2 You can't find a card that says that ?
label2 I wish Penny didn't have to work  she loves camping 
label2 Yeah  maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff 
label2 My point is  immortality is not only a possibility  it is real 
label1 I'm sorry  I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's 
label1 Last one 
label1 That's an easy guess  I'm clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders 
label1 Alright  But I'm watching you 
label1 Thank you 
label2 Not you  him 
label1 When last we spoke  you said you needed time 
label1 I'm getting dizzy 
label2 Really ?
label1 I'd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing  Since you and I are both reluctant to go  I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it 
label1 I'm not upset  I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it 
label2 Well  there's nothing you can do about it  so relax  sit back  enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails 
label2 I really appreciate this 
label1 Good  because not only has that ship sailed  if it hit an iceberg  countless men would perish 
label1 Would you pass the mustard ?
label2 Yeah  So ?
label2 Why does it have to be about anything ? Can't a fella ask his buddy to relocate  no questions asked ?
label1 Well  there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter  but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out 
label1 Leonard  Penny  excellent  I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together  and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere  I will  In the meantime  I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits 
label1 Well here's an interesting turn of events 
label2 Oh  thanks  I thought I had more 
label1 Thank you so much  I can't believe you're '
label1 Oh  thank you  I wasn't sure I was gonna to make it  But my mother gave me some ice chips  my sister told me to breathe  and I just thought to myself  Sheldon  if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie  you can make it through this 
label2 But you don't like other people 
label2 Oh  come on !
label1 Oh  good  Dinner's here 
label1 Well  I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance 
label1 You have to get rid of the chair 
label1 Oh  yes  it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina 
label2 Exactly  Thank you  Do me a favour  tell Koothrappali that next time you see him 
label2 What if he doesn't ?
label2 You don't want that  do you ?
label2 This is ridiculous  Dammit  Sheldon  snap out of it  You're a physicist  you belong at the University doing research  not hiding in your room 
label2 Okay  if you're gonna start sniffing people  I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel 
label2 Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal ?
label1 Yes  but they have no Icee machines  Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign  I might add 
label1 If you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye  I can't help you  I've been informed that he's now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy 
label1 Well  you didn't specify 
label1 Look  look  here I am standing next to the incubator  Uh  here is a microscopic view of the cells 
label1 And of course  the answer is 130 adoseconds 
label2 You and Leslie ?
label1 Everybody has a date  Even you  Mario  going after Princess Peach  And what am I doing  I'm just enabling you 
label1 It's not  That's why Leonard does it 
label2 You bumped the table and you know it 
label2 I didn't agree with him 
label1 Where's the mouthwash ?
label1 I'm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping 
label2 Really ? Why ?
label1 Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy 
label1 You're tricking me  You tell me the truth  what do we get ?
label1 Oh  you'd like to catch up on the events of the day  All right  Well  there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box  I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems  and  oh  yes  in a moment filled with biblical resonance  pride wenteth before my fall  causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz 
label1 But if I don't come into work  what am I supposed to do with myself ?
label1 See ? Howard's on my side 
label1 Excuse me  but the problem is not solved  If your head had been accidentally amputated  and we transplanted a dog's head in its place  would that be ' problem solved ' ?
label2 What are you talking about  the date went fine 
label1 Boy  double-sixes again  You know  if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes  I wouldn't believe it  I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here 
label2 Now  we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves  but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye 
label2 No  no  no  I  I looked  and there's  there's  there's no more tickets 
label1 If I were not being careful  your telling me to be careful would not make me careful 
label1 Could you ? That would solve everything  You are the best  I'll see you at dinner tonight ?
label1 Oh  yeah  I'd have to say it's the most exiting time in the history of the field 
label2 No  no  No  it's too late  I'm your bran muffin  Probably fat-free and good for your colon 
label1 Oh  no  this is pomegranate juice  It's all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants 
label2 nard : Yeah 
label1 Stealing is against the law !
label1 Oh  well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence 
label2 Forget the robot  What happened to you ?
label2 Are you sure ? That doesn't sound right 
label2 Don't worry  you'll find another job 
label2 There's a big difference  Arrow  Lantern 
label1 Can I make you a cup of tea ?
label1 Oh no  let's assume that they can  Lois Lane is falling  accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second  Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel  Miss Lane  who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour  hits them  and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces 
label2 I'm going to talk anyway 
label1 Do I say stop what  or just throw in the towel ?
label1 No  after you  as we are currently crushing you  Wesley 
label1 At this moment  our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states  Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party  you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend  I'm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger's Friendship 
label1 366 367 '
label2 Hey  you guys let Stuart live with you  Why not Raj  too ?
label1 Oh  nice job  man-hands 
label1 Oh  quite all right  After my forehead melanoma scare I've learned not to sweat the small stuff  Well  sorry  I don't have all the ingredients to make chai tea 
label1 Hey  What are you trying to pull ? The president of science isn't in here 
label2 I's the smallest size they had  except the one for dogs  I can't believe they had one for dogs 
label2 Sure  sure  How did you get into this place ?
label2 He's Glissinda the troll 
label2 Those are not mine 
label1 The fact is I'm quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate 
label2 Should've let Sheldon come 
label2 Well  you have to put in a credit card number  but it's fun 
label2 Oh  what the hell 
label1 Nothing  I just wanted to make Raj stop talking 
label1 She doesn't want to live with Leonard  so he has to come live here again  She's the snake in our garden  She's the reason we can't be happy 
label2 Well  in case you were in the mood for baseball  I didn't want to look ridiculous 
label1 It's colloquial  a conversation opener  So  do you find the weather satisfying ? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team ?
label1 I always tell people  if you have only one day in Los Angeles  make it a train day 
label2 No  Penny  it's okay  I can handle this  I'm not a dwarf  I'm a Hobbit  A Hobbit  Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory ?
label1 What if someone kidnaps me  forces me to record my voice  and then cuts off my thumb ?
label1 Plus  there's almost no chance we'll see any of our coworkers half naked 
label1 Is this it ? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life in front of Leonard and Penny 
label2 Does it really need to say that ?
label2 That  that's brilliant 
label2 An old boyfriend who's definitely not gay  That's what a guy likes to hear  definitely 
label1 I own nine pairs of pants 
label1 When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot  he gave him all sorts of helpful advice  So  um  what do you got for me ?
label2 Yeah  I'll call you back 
label1 Is that you  Raj ? I don't recognize your edge 
label1 What about the roommate agreement ? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee  Which only sits on alternate years  Yeah  and by the way  it sits over there 
label1 That would be ideal  If a person like that existed  I would sign on  no further questions asked 
label2 If I stand  I'll vomit 
label2 Well  maybe we shouldn't have sunk to his level 
label1 Like what ?
label1 It's called sleep and it's my bedtime  Nighty-night  y'all 
label1 Although  I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract
label2 Hey  do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you'd ever had ?
label1 He's not here  Maybe the Avenger summoned him 
label2 Why are you learning Chinese ?
label2 We want you back on the project with us 
label1 You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain ? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos  And they'd offer to toast it for me  too 
label1 That's remarkable  If pepperoni were an explosive substance  you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports 
label2 You're joking 
label1 Oh  I forgot Sensational Spider-Man 
label1 Why ? Oh  Penny  Penny  Penny 
label2 I know 
label1 Of course  Barry ?
label1 No  I'm just going to tell her I'm coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho 
label2 On the one hand  if I say yes '
label2 Hey  what are you doing here ?
label2 Ah  I also made oatmeal 
label1 It is  right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget   and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  heroes in a half-shell 
label1 Yeh  why ? Eh  why ? Oh  that's why 
label1 Hello  Bert  What is your flag-related comment or query ?
label1 No  that's the least of our worries  I've been doing some research on addiction  both the biochemical and behavioural aspects  and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie 
label2 Nope  It's pretty exciting 
label1 I'm sorry  Ooh  Penny  it's as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches 
label1 I can't bring the nitrogen tank down 
label2 So  boys  how was the pyjama party ? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes ?
label1 Why would she keep something from me  you know ? I shared my body with that woman  And my Netflix password  They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her 
label1 No  and also  I don't want to disappoint you  I  you know  come on  it's your birthday  I can soldier through this 
label1 ldon : You're welcome 
label2 Look  if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me 
label2 Maybe  but you also think nine minutes isn't a while  so what do you know ?
label2 Hello Lesley 
label2 So  how'd it go with Ramona last night ?
label2 Really ?
label1 I forgot my flash drive 
label2 Is this all stuff you want me to try on ?
label1 A cross we all must bear  You know  in difficult moments like this  I often turn to a force greater than myself 
label1 The statement stands for itself 
label1 I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain 
label1 Yeah  additionally  you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future 
label1 Don't worry  Officer  They just love each other  We're not smuggling drugs 
label2 Aw  Here's what I think of your roommate agreement 
label2 No  you're not  You're here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head 
label2 Yeah ? What are you keeping ?
label1 I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza 
label1 Raj  you were being a good friend  and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour  I hope that you can accept my apology 
label1 Here's the problem  I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204  and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall 
label1 You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman ?
label1 Amy  the Daleks are right on my tail  quick  we need to reset the time circuits  Oh  no  I left my sonic screwdriver behind 
label1 Stop counting !
label1 Very well  then  Get over my knee  Let's begin 
label2 All right  How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny ?
label2 Uh-huh  Anyway  I'm not sure she's the best fit for our little  how should we call it  rebel alliance 
label2 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
label2 Oh  my god  what did you do ?
label1 Well  the contents are irrelevant  A legal bailment has been created  Does that mean nothing to you ?
label1 Sorry won't bring their kites down  Ow ! String burn ! String burn !
label2 You bought my mom's book ?
label2 Okay  how do we catch it ?
label2 I don't know  What do you want me to do ?
label2 Onion dip  it's onion dip 
label2 He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes  and wants to know if I'd take a look at it 
label1 Oh  good  you're home  I need you to do me a favour 
label1 Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it 
label2 Look at me  Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom 
label1 I'll go for two hundred  that time machine stays right where it is 
label2 Sea bass  I'll have the sea bass 
label1 No  no  no  no  no  no  no '
label1 I don't know  two  three days  Not important  I don't need sleep  I need answers  I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth 
label2 Glowing letters appear on the chest that read  If squashed to death you wish not to be  sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory 
label1 Well  hello to you  too 
label1 Wait  You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table ?
label2 Uh-huh  it goes with my corduroy suit 
label1 Ah  good  Penny  you're here to exchange gifts  You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer 
label1 I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea  You thought of it September 22nd  2007  Two days later  Penny moved in  and so much blood rushed to your genitals  your brain became a ghost town 
label1 Well  your expectations have been subverted  Aha 
label2 Why would you open mine ?
label1 You're not Mr  D'Onofrio  I get my hair cut by Mr  D'Onofrio  You believe this guy ?
label2 No  I didn't just move in  First we had to iron out a few details 
label2 Come on  is that really necessary ?
label2 What was I supposed to say 
label1 You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole 
label1 We accept your challenge  Name a time and place 
label2 We can help you  We can be your team  Like  uh  Professor Xavier and his X-Men 
label2 The one with the little onions ? Mmm 
label1 Oh  Alright  noted  Sorry 
label1 Wow  Didn't see that coming 
label1 Thank you 
label1 Oh  good  Hah-hah !
label2 Okay  uh  how do I put this ? Um  are you familiar with Darwin's observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands ?
label1 Robert Oppenheimer was lonely 
label2 I'm getting to it 
label1 In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me  he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo 
label1 Oh  I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz  He is going to be so lost  Look at this section over here  Even I don't really understand it 
label1 Morning  Professor Stevens  Don't look at that whiteboard  That's my math  not your math  Keep walking  nosey 
label2 I forget  Which one is Hammer of the Gods ?
label2 I'm telling you  the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need  We've got a hit 
label1 Well  if it's of any help  I've read all the great moral philosophers  including Dr  Seuss 
label1 Morning 
label1 So you admit that you're an egotist ?
label1 You had gelato with Stan Lee ?
label1 Point taken  You may want to sit up 
label1 And a funny Greek letter 
label1 It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot 
label2 Amy broke up with Sheldon 
label1 Can't you surprise him in some other way ? For example  I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment 
label2 Don't say anything 
label2 In fact  if you want  we can do it right here on Sheldon's spot 
label1 If that changes  let me know  And finally  area rugs  pro or con ?
label2 Okay  well  there  there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on 
label1 Amy  look  I'm on a unicycle !
label2 Yeah  I'm sorry  too  We're about to share the rest of our lives together  It's our money  who cares who has it ?
label2 Well  do you think when she and I had that conversation  she left people off her list ?
label2 Oh  right  no  I'm lactose intolerant 
label1 All he had was an idea 
label1 Well  there are others who might be more qualified  but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache  Now  I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking  so why don't you take a few moments to discuss it ?
label2 What's in the bag ?
label2 Well  I don't know how to do that 
label1 And how difficult it is to do when she's bloated  cranky and crampy ? Continue 
label1 I've been thinking about time travel again 
label2 Come on 
label1 I wouldn't 
label1 Well  I believe I've done it  And I'm only saying believe to sound modest  because  sweet Sam Houston  I did it 
label2 Well  we got to make a run to the hardware store 
label1 All right 
label2 No  you should  Absolutely  That was me being pedantic  That's our first bug  You reported it  I can fix that  See ? This is good 
label2 I couldn't just take the compliment  I had to ask why  You know  I do understand what you're feeling  My brother and sister's accomplishments have always been held over my head 
label1 I'm nervous  I hope people will be around to watch even though it's Valentine's Day 
label2 I'm sorry  I'll start again 
label1 No  of course not  They thrive on our suffering 
label1 Mai du lui tsa 
label2 Do you know how much your car costs ?
label2 Oh  good  an English accent  the sexiest accent you can have 
label2 I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow 
label1 It's dirty laundry  You're up 
label2 I'm sorry  I'm-I'm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell  so '
label2 Oh  don't worry  They gave me this vibrating coaster 
label2 I just want to say one more thing about this  Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we're a bad couple 
label2 Oh  wow 
label1 Here's an interesting fact about flags 
label2 I know it is  and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way 
label1 Oh  Ubuntu  you are my favourite Linux-based operating system 
label2 And then nothing  I stopped it  But it still bothers me  and I wanted you to know 
label2 No  Lactose  Gas 
label1 She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease 
label1 Really ? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much 
label2 Well  yeah 
label1 I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie  he's kind of a bummer 
label2 I do have to ask you one favour 
label1 A powerful laxative 
label1 Oh  but I won't be there 
label2 Booting 
label2 You're too close to it  but Amy has had a huge impact on you 
label1 You didn't break up  she dumped you 
label1 That's preposterous  Tell her  Leonard 
label1 Oh  he'll be back  Wine and a girl in the dark  he's gonna be bored out of his mind 
label1 Ah  because it's in Long Beach  and I don't drive 
label2 It's nine o'clock  where you been ?
label2 It's take your daughter to work day 
label2 Double guacamole ?
label2 Oh  maybe we shouldn't bother him 
label2 Then what do you need ?
label1 Tell me what ?
label1 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on 
label1 I expected to see Howard throw the baseball  finish my hot dog  and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade 
label1 I'm sorry  It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet 
label1 That's not the secret knock  This is the secret knock 
label1 Okay  one second 
label2 Boy  you will not let this go  will you ? Oh  jeez 
label2 Then why did you have Chinese food with us ?
label2 A death ray ?
label2 Yeah  I know  I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half  You always said you had yoga 
label1 Penny ?
label2 I don't know what to say 
label1 I can't do this  And for your information  Leonard  the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades  it grows out of the belly button on my neck 
label1 I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes 
label1 Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy ?
label1 Oh no !
label2 Okay  well  thanks for letting me know 
label1 That's a lot of money for only one colour 
label2 What the hell ? How long has she been here ?
label2 No  no  it's not like that  It's  uh  I don't know what it's like  But there is something I should prepare you for 
label2 When were you going to tell me about this ?
label2 You got it  If this sweater shuts you up  I'm gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know  Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD 
label2 So don't watch TV  Read a book 
label2 Sheldon's Kryptonite 
label1 Yes  actually it would  but let's see how the lid goes  I'm not strong enough  Leonard  you'll have to do it 
label1 Amy  if you want to be my girlfriend again  I really want to be your boyfriend 
label1 Mother  she's an atheist  not a vampire 
label2 How's that been working for you ?
label2 Thank you  You look very nice 
label2 What do you mean ?
label2 Now that Penny and I are engaged  I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements 
label1 The only thing we can do  Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep 
label2 They bought it 
label1 Oh  This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility  Raj  you're back in  He likes monkeys 
label2 Oh  people get things they don't deserve all the time  Look at me with you 
label2 Sheldon ? Sheldon  are you okay ?
label2 Actually  he's pretty cool  I mean  not only is he a brilliant scientist  but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier  he collects vintage motorcycles  he plays in a rock band 
label2 You believe this guy ? He has to be the best at everything 
label1 No  that doesn't seem any more likely 
label2 Fine  Just tell me what to do  and I'll do it 
label1 Very well  You got married spur of the moment  I don't see why your divorce should be any different 
label1 Where the dangers are double  and the pleasures are few  Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines  yes  it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine 
label2 Sheldon's escaped and is terrorizing the village 
label2 I know you-you don't want to hear it  but she was there with Stuart 
label1 Was I hit on the head by a coconut 
label1 Could you be more specific ?
label1 Really ? It's soaking wet 
label1 Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo ?
label1 There's one more zero  You forgot the time parameter 
label2 So  this is nice  First time we've all gotten together to eat 
label2 That's just great 
label1 Really ?
label2 What do you think about it  Sheldon ?
label1 On the contrary  you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities  We're not friends with benefits 
label1 Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk ?
label2 Yeah  I feel pretty good about myself  You think we can outrun him ?
label2 Shut up 
label1 But I said I'm sorry 
label1 Oh  Well  I thought we were going in order 
label1 Actually  I don't need a team  I could easily defeat you single-handedly  But the rules require four  so may I introduce  the third floor janitor  he lady from the lunchroom  and  my Spanish is not good  either her son or her butcher  And what about your team ? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship ?
label2 I'm sorry  You're pretty  I'm stupid  Hello  Uh  just checking again for Hofstadter  Still gonna be an hour ?
label2 Oh  yeah  The Mr  Spock cuckoo clock 
label2 Not funny 
label2 Uh  yeah  it's Raj's sister  It's kind of tough  She's in India  Also  her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white 
label2 Just nod and smile  He's almost gone 
label1 Leonard  these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers  I don't like my own sweat touching my skin  how do you think I feel about theirs ?
label2 The worst part was watching her carve that turkey 
label2 You've heard of him ?
label2 Unbelievable 
label1 He's evil  He plays evil mind games  Did he tell you his grandmother died ?
label2 Yeah  where's he gonna sleep ?
label2 Good  Slow 
label1 Wait  They might be hostile 
label1 And the answer was Zack  correct ?
label2 Howard  Howard  look at this 
label2 I know  it's high-resolution sadness 
label2 Where are we going ?
label1 I am moving on  I'm going to be a Bozite 
label2 It's gonna get crazy 
label1 Are you experiencing dehydration  headache  nausea and shame ?
label1 Excuse me  I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere 
label1 You know this is all your fault 
label1 Anyway  um  I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you  only one of which is true  and then we don't tell you which one it is  you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence 
label2 Little bit 
label2 Hey  if you're hungry  there's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door 
label2 We'll miss you  Sheldon 
label1 No point  It's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle  What makes you chuckle  Leonard ?
label1 Here's two dollars  Go buy some beef jerky 
label2 Sorry  I'm moving a little slow  I think I bruised my coccyx 
label2 What's that ?
label2 Uh  Th  that's true  How late did we stay up last night ?
label2 Yeah  I guessed that 
label1 Why would you say that ?
label2 So  listen  do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water ?
label1 It's midnight  Happy birthday 
label1 No  because we don't celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia 
label2 Uh  could I talk to you in the hall for a sec ?
label1 Yeah  me  too  Triple digits  I'm not gonna lie  feels pretty good 
label1 Boy  oh  boy  This vacation is off to a wonderful start  The smell of formaldehyde  the whir of the centrifuge  the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection  Mm  I can already feel my cares just melting away 
label2 Howard's right  that'll never work 
label2 Just try it 
label1 No  no  I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person 
label1 What if they cut the power ?
label1 Yes  I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it 
label1 Oh  great  She's smart  insightful and she has a very unique way of  you know  revering me 
label1 Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy 
label1 Leonard  I'm no expert on meditation  but if you're trying to calm yourself down  I believe the word is Om 
label2 So wait  you're just gonna give up ?
label2 How about the toaster oven ?
label2 So  what do you think  is there a professional downside to doing it ?
label1 Yeah  Milk Duds  with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour  are the most apologetic of the boxed candies 
label2 Then we'll go to a hotel 
label2 Yes  you can 
label1 What happened ?
label2 Because I've been busy  because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up  and mostly  and I can't stress how key this is  because I don't want to 
label1 Amen to that 
label2 Do not tell Wolowitz 
label1 Really ? I never imagined it any other way 
label2 Actually  you did do one of them together 
label1 When you play Chutes and Ladders  do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders ?
label2 nard : Uh  yeah  experimental physics 
label1 What kind of tea would you like ?
label1 But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump 
label1 Where's Howard ?
label1 I said give it to me 
label1 Hold on  Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209 ?
label2 Warriors  unsheathe your weapons  magic wielders raise your wands 
label1 Oh  dear lord 
label1 You know what I'm going to do ? I am going to sit here and just let them stew 
label2 Anyway  we can e-mail  and I think the phone connections are pretty good 
label2 Sheldon's in jail ?
label1 That's a good sign  right ?
label1 There's a lot of harm in trying something new  That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits 
label1 They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on  But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder  you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man 
label2 I didn't have clams 
label2 All right  fine  Hey  can you think of a reason I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me ?
label1 I often forget other people have limitations  It's so sad 
label2 Sheldon ? Sheldon ?
label1 Actually  it turns out I can 
label2 Got you a little something  too 
label2 Heartrate  pheromones  etc  yes 
label1 You're welcome  Anyhow  on a scale of 1 to 5  with 1 being always initiated by him  and 5 being always initiated by you  how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin ?
label1 But I occupy the moral high ground 
label1 Looking for something ?
label1 Oh  bad news  Amy's making me go shopping with her later  so looks like none of us can go 
label2 You know  maybe we didn't have opportunities like this when we were growing up  but right now  there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip 
label2 You know  I can really do this by myself 
label1 Impressive as that may be  Monte is not us  Monte has no fear 
label2 Mm  this one comes with music and flowers  Oh  they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet 
label2 Sounds rough 
label1 Please  please  please  please  please  please  please 
label1 Can I have one more moment with Leonard ?
label1 No  no  that's crazy  You go ahead and talk while I figure it out 
label2 Well  DTS has more low end  so ' okay 
label1 I'm Kermit  You're Scooter 
label1 Well  I should hope so  I don't see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense  Not even a good-bye ? You see  that's the kind of thing that makes people think you're weird  Poor kid  She just doesn't see it 
label1 Here  day one  uh  this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn't because there were cracker crumbs on it  As it was first class  I suspect Ritz  This is the train bathroom  This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom 
label1 No  no that's true  gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple 
label2 If you're trying to make me feel better  it's not working 
label2 Okay  now  do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card ?
label1 Will you guys keep it down ?
label1 Isn't that the best ? She's like Grandma Spider-Man 
label2 It wouldn't be the worst thing if we were more active 
label1 Right  just one thing before we start 
label2 I'm sorry  So  listen  I heard something about him  Can you keep it between us ?
label1 I can't  I'm naked 
label2 The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff  You 
label2 Come on  Howard  the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero 
label1 When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece  that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves  Ugh 
label2 Couple of weirdos  Why ?
label1 I rest my case  Amy  don't you agree we should leave now and get in line ?
label2 You know  rather than mock me  my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it 
label2 Good  good  I'll tell you what happens 
label1 I can't believe I read this table wrong  I blame you 
label1 Don't  He's making our case 
label2 When the transvestite lived here  you didn't care how he kept the place 
label2 I can't do that 
label2 Thank you 
label1 I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership 
label1 Point of order  I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous  No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger  when common sense dictates it should be an army ant 
label1 Please 
label1 You're parched and weary from battle  You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest  most delicious ale in all the realm 
label1 Fine  What about epilepsy ?
label2 Tell me whether or not to go through with the date 
label1 They sound delicious  but this money is earmarked for scones 
label2 Fine  I'll publish 
label2 You've got to be kidding me  You friended Stuart on Facebook ?
label1 It was a compliment  I believe in giving credit where credit is due 
label1 Following in the footsteps of Kirk  Crunch and Kangaroo 
label2 Okay  fine  what do you suggest ?
label1 We don't have that option  we've accepted the challenge  We can't run away from a fight 
label2 No one told you to taste them  Come on  is  is this good or not ?
label1 I believe I do 
label1 It wasn't a breakup  A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend 
label1 Because I am 
label1 But I thought you wanted to cancel ?
label2 No one's a scientist like Howard 
label1 Well done  it worked  we're going 
label2 But all you did was complain when he did that 
label2 Hey  how'd it go ?
label2 Great  You have a girlfriend  Howard's got a girlfriend  Sheldon's got a girl '
label1 Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother 
label2 So I'm like a bran muffin 
label1 I don't understand the question 
label2 It's actually ho  ho  ho  but you'll get the hang of it  Thought it'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme 
label2 ' Priya  can I come in ?
label2 Why didn't you say something ?
label1 Well  thank you  How thoughtful  Would you like a chocolate
label2 What am I supposed to say ? Sure  Penny  I'm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment  Well  Leonard  it doesn't matter if you're cool or not because I'm Penny and I'm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want ! Oh  I get it ! You think you're doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me ! No  no  Leonard ! I'm doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you !
label2 For the tenth time  my mittens were slippery !
label1 You  too  Oh  don't forget  Tuesday the air filters need to be changed 
label1 The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him  and no one else was 
label2 So do we  And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things 
label1 That's smart  because Sheldon 1  Amy 0 
label1 Why wasn't that Plan A ?
label1 I sure did  Oh  my goodness  Well  from Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader  I'm having a heck of a ride  Yeah  look  clearly  good things happen when I'm in charge  Now  why don't you boys step aside  let me knock this project out ?
label1 Are you listening to yourself  it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength  it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings  an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun 
label2 If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon  we can try marriage counselling 
label2 Delightful  Listen  I don't know what you're doing right now  but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth 
label1 Is he okay ?
label2 Don't you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date ?
label2 Yes  please shut up  So  um  Dave  don't you think you and I should get back to the lab ? You know  that dark matter isn't going to detect itself 
label1 I am asserting  in the event that Batman's death proves permanent  that original Robin  Dick Grayson  is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl 
label1 All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth '
label2 Un-unravelable ?
label2 I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom 
label2 Not yet 
label1 May I point out that for eight long months  I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling  the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room  and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore 
label1 Only way we'll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server  I have it ready to go  but I wasn't gonna do it without you 
label1 You tracked my phone ?
label2 Good  I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge 
label1 Oh  I'm fantastic  never been better  I had my first energy drink and I feel great  Hey  you guys want to wrestle ? We can do arm  thumb  mud  sumo  Nah  we're not fat enough  or wearing diapers 
label1 Then why are you attacking us ?
label2 Sheldon  I don't care if you get scalped tickets with us or not  but please don't be creepy and go stalking this poor guy  You're gonna get in trouble 
label2 nard : I  I'm sorry  uh  in the morning  Around eight 
label1 We have a bowl  Our keys go in a bowl  You should get a bowl 
label1 I'd say she's copying you again  but I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall 
label2 Aaaa-aw !
label1 Yes  but you wouldn't understand 
label1 Fascinating  What's in it ?
label2 Well  I'd like to be green  but you know you always take it 
label2 It's okay  Did the right thing  You idiot !
label1 You remember my mother 
label1 Of course I could 
label2 I don't know  It-it-it's hard sometimes  Everywhere you go  guys hit on you  even if I'm standing right there  And they're all taller than me  Why is everyone taller than me ? You know what  this is all in my head  It's my problem  not yours 
label1 I will admit nothing of the sort  And now if you'll excuse me  I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped 
label1 Hold that thought  Leonard  a moment 
label1 All right 
label1 If the surgery is successful  the snoring is gone  And if you die during surgery  the snoring is gone 
label2 nard : Okay 
label2 No  I just got a text from Stuart  Brent Spiner is at the party 
label1 Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship  The favour 
label1 Well  first of all  I'm quite fond of Amy 
label2 Sheldon  this interview is supposed to be about me 
label2 Not right now  Sheldon 
label2 No  He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out 
label2 It's not Simon Says 
label1 Can I respond now ?
label2 You're not helping 
label2 We're pinned down 
label1 Before you say yes  it's not the movie about the big dog 
label2 I just took him for shoes 
label1 All right  you can't breathe our air without an inhaler  he's allergic to Earth nuts  but I'm the alien 
label1 I'm sorry  I didn't get that 
label1 Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard 
label2 What do you mean ?
label1 That's how you start a psychotherapy session ? How am I doing ? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious  Instead  I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph's 
label2 No  hang on  Hang on  Are all those things equal to you ?
label1 What  you're not my mother 
label2 Look  you're here  we have plenty of room 
label1 Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed  Would you like to bring some Cylon toast ?
label2 Bye  buddy  Sheldon ?
label2 Why can't you be fat  too ?
label2 Come on  come home with us and tomorrow I'll  I'll take you to Legoland 
label2 nard : Telling you ? Telling you 
label2 You know what ? Let's just get a pizza 
label2 You do what you want  I'm not touching another man's honey tree 
label1 I don't like bearclaws 
label1 After you used the facilities at the gas station  did you make a purchase ?
label2 I'm married  I don't have to be attractive 
label2 What are you saying ? We're not coordinated enough to play sports ?
label2 So  Sheldon  how you doing ?
label1 To the planetarium 
label2 What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt ? You got to be Jabba's head  and I got to be his fat slug butt 
label2 Oh  So you chose that when you become turned on  you turn into Speedy Gonzalez ?
label1 Hey  how did it go ?
label1 I must say  I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment  As I mentioned  the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times  and later  the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale  You ask anyone  that's a hot date 
label1 Go on  give him your lunch money 
label2 Oh  yes  you do  You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E  T  relationship with him 
label2 Sheldon  let's go 
label2 Hey  Penny  don't get upset  Here  I love you  but  no  I will not marry you 
label1 Really ?
label2 Sorry again 
label1 I need soup 
label1 Must be out of range 
label2 Penny's not answering my texts 
label1 I don't have a sad song  I'm not a child 
label2 They asked me to come in 
label2 Right  Uh yeah  funny  Uh  that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer  Raj  get them some glasses 
label1 Oh  I'm outraged 
label2 Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect ?
label1 Of course not  I'm too busy to be sick 
label2 Okay  um  well  look  it's just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick 
label2 Hey  we're here 
label1 I can't tell you 
label1 Leonard  when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her  and now look  we're going to be late for the movies 
label1 Okay  Just to be on the safe side  am I in any danger of getting juggler's elbow ?
label1 Oh  there's no need to interact with me  I'm just here to observe 
label1 So no more interviews ?
label2 Come on  How can you be sad when you're going home with all five-foot-six of this ?
label2 Okay  um  here's the thing  um  sometimes people  good people  you know  they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own  you know  kind of  addicted 
label1 Sorry  I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish 
label2 What makes you think I can convince her ?
label2 You okay ?
label1 I'm okay  I'm okay  I'm not okay 
label1 Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other  Case closed 
label2 He never disappoints  does he ?
label2 Yeah  you do  You dog  you 
label2 I'm going to get some fries  You want anything ?
label2 What are you doing ? Use the door 
label2 That's the part you have a problem with ?
label2 Okay  good night 
label2 Okay  have fun 
label1 He does that all the time  doesn't he ? 15 
label1 Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy 
label1 Well  my new shoes are not made for running 
label1 About what ?
label2 Oh  how'd it go at the mechanic ?
label1 I can't tell you why I can't tell you  So I guess there's two things I can't tell you 
label1 I beg to differ  I used to live in those genitals  And if someone wants to move into my old room  I should at least get a vote 
label1 I didn't notice 
label1 I like cows 
label1 And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again ? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics  All right  I'll play  What self-important  preening fraud are they honouring this year ?
label2 Oh  hello  Join us 
label1 It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive  and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology 
label2 What are you talking about ?
label1 It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing  at which  if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed  I suck the big one 
label2 Yeah  uh  um  Penny and I got married 
label2 Last one holding the ring decides its fate  I know  it sounds silly 
label2 Buh-buh-buh-buh ! What do you want for it ?
label1 Hold on  Is it back pay or is it a gift ?
label1 Be right back 
label1 You did not break up with Joyce Kim  she defected to North Korea 
label1 Obviously  waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity  that requires a great deal of analysis and planning  Bazinga ! You know  using positive reinforcement techniques  I could train that behaviour out of her in a week 
label1 Hold that thought ! Professor Hawking has made a move  Boy  oh  boy  Oh  it's only a matter of time before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other  I'll be Coop  He'll be Wheels  If he's okay with that 
label1 Brimstone 
label2 For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school 
label2 I'm just saying  sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside 
label1 It's a physical relationship  too  Hand-holding  hugging  even on hot days  Ow  Okay  here's a new one  Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table  How do you like it when I do it to you ? Not so much  huh ?
label2 Don't ask me  A little elf did it 
label1 Don't take it personally  it's his pathology  he can't talk to women 
label2 Obviously  when I saw that you were in ours  I went and used another one 
label1 Do you know 2001 : A Space Odyssey ? All right  now that's soothing 
label1 All right 
label2 Well  do you really think I have a shot ?
label2 Oh  We're scientists 
label1 Oh  it's just a meeting  One simple meeting 
label1 There being no objections '
label1 You don't really believe in that superstition  do you ?
label1 But after months of struggling  I'm finally making progress 
label2 Thanks 
label2 Interesting  Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB  What's KBB ?
label1 But you didn't even hear the details 
label2 Should I say something ? I feel like I should say something 
label1 Mmm  great news  Leonard  I've solved my Penny gift dilemma 
label1 Once again  defeated by your own prurient interests 
label2 Okay  let me try it this way  uh  I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team 
label2 Well then we'll avoid Finkleday  we'll meet the new department head  congratulate him  shake his hand and go 
label2 I don't want it better  I want it my way 
label1 I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about  you begged me to come  I came  there's just no pleasing you 
label1 I heard a woman laughing 
label2 And you as well  Mr  Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing 
label2 A big kiss  On the mouth 
label1 This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop  No  one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons 
label2 Stay out of it  Kevin Smith 
label2 She meant Emily 
label2 You want to talk about it ?
label2 The poor guy on the bike  I had a nice time 
label2 You told her I lied  why would you tell her I lied ?
label2 All right  but just for the record  I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it 
label2 ' Thank you 
label2 How'd you get ready so fast ?
label1 Drag out our mattress and put it over here  then go across the hall  get their mattress and put it over here  But before you do any of that  scratch my nose 
label2 What's going on ?
label1 Leonard ?
label1 Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception  Do you have anything to say for yourself ?
label1 Did you see that ? He just cut the line 
label1 Don't be ridiculous  I have no peers 
label1 The dog koira  The roof katto  Grapes ryp leet 
label2 That's my girl 
label1 Building on building on that  there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado 
label2 Okay  bye-bye 
label1 Little comfort tonight  I look like a Hell's Angel 
label2 I never know what to do in these situations  Should I give him a heads-up ?
label1 Are you trying to scare me ? ' Cause you're succeeding 
label2 Oh  I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face when he sees that I didn't let this get to me 
label1 Did you laugh ?
label2 Maybe  if it's a cute little cuddly cat 
label2 Two women at the same time ? Nice job  playa 
label1 Thank you 
label2 What is ? No  not like that ! Just  Leonard went to the office 
label2 nard : What'd you do that for ? I had plenty of time 
label1 I know  and Amy says I can't have a train room 
label1 What if a simulated van rear-ends me ?
label2 Come on  everyone to the hospital 
label2 Well  if he does  I'll see if my bear has a friend 
label1 Well  now don't you feel silly 
label1 Yeah  well  who wants to spend the whole weekend  running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters  That's for babies 
label2 Here we are 
label1 Chat ? We don't chat  At least not offline 
label1 I'm the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com  dot net  and dot org  What does that tell you ?
label1 What are you talking about ?
label2 Just Bilbo Baggins ' sword over there 
label2 Oh  Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad  but only the white people felt bad 
label2 Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life ?
label1 Have a chocolate 
label2 That's not it because you're clearly upset 
label2 Ask him 
label2 Really ? LeVar Burton's coming here ?
label2 Even during ? ' Cause sometimes I have questions 
label2 No  no  I'm confident  It's not like I'm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation  Although  this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it 
label1 That's true  but had I done something under the line  there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen who can't produce a single form of ID 
label1 Hey  if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie  you draw a glass of milk next to it 
label2 Really ? What happened ?
label2 Raj and Howard are at Howard's mom's  but should we call the girls and see if they want to come ?
label2 All right  let's all just calm down  Nobody wants to report anybody 
label1 What I need is to get to work 
label1 And I will continue to do so !
label2 Oh  my turn  my turn 
label1 Uh  roses  bengay  and Dr  Scholls foot powder 
label2 Do I have to ?
label2 Okay  Sheldon  I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago  and I know we rented it on your card  But it's been  like  seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened  So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are  what if this one time you just tried staying calm ?
label1 Oh  very much so 
label1 Of course I'm sure  Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics  the sign's been changed 
label2 I'm sorry  That I asked 
label1 Whatever 
label1 That's ridiculous  I am a grown man  I am a professional scientist  And I currently occupy the moral high ground 
label1 Why would I see her again ? I already have a dentist 
label2 Hey  where's Bernadette ?
label1 All you did was offer maternal care and affection  and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior 
label1 Okay  I think we've found the problem here  It's not the table at all  It's you 
label1 Fine  I'll do it 
label2 I can't believe you're married to that idiot 
label1 I don't think it worked 
label2 Sheldon  Kripke's not smarter than you  You just got stuck on a wrong path  Happened to Einstein  He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades 
label1 I think this is the place 
label1 I did it  Had to go to three clothing stores  but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother 
label2 Okay  fine  like a pinky swear 
label1 You tell me  Dear Esteemed Colleagues  as you may know  I have requested to change my field of study  My decision to do so is  I believe  in the best interest of science  At your convenience  I'd be happy to explain it to you in words you'll understand 
label1 Leonard ?
label1 See  my initial approach to Kripke  had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo  when he was new at the zoo 
label2 Because '  uh  Friday  we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium 
label1 Hey  Is everything smoothed out with Amy ?
label2 I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie  You're a young man 
label1 Roofing 
label1 Thanks  Leonard  now he's not gonna think I'm cool 
label1 Yeah  well  they shouldn't have  My calculations were wrong  There must be some resonance between the elements I didn't know about 
label1 No  once again  I'm throwing you a bone  And once again  you are welcome 
label1 Yes  it is  There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement 
label2 Oh  good  Is the baby born yet ?
label1 It was rife with historical inaccuracies  For example  the tavern girl serving flagons of mead  now her costume was obviously Germanic  but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead  At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine 
label1 You  the president of the university  his wife  their sullen teenage daughter  That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it 
label2 Yeah  the wait is finally over 
label1 No  no  no  you've misstated the atomic weight of the target 
label2 If you ever need a break  the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee 
label2 Okay  um  look  I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you 
label2 Yeah  but we all want to hear it from you 
label2 Oh  good 
label1 Oh  good  I got it right  Are you upset ?
label2 It really is 
label2 She's not Catwoman  she's just a generic cat 
label1 Sarcasm ?
label2 Oh  you poor thing  you're sweating  That's so much worse than having your car stolen 
label1 Leonard has a lady over 
label2 I drive you to work every day  my brain must look like the Hulk 
label1 Well  aren't you a peach 
label2 Sheldon  don't make that noise  it's disrespectful 
label2 No  I haven't 
label1 On oatmeal day ?
label2 You okay ?
label1 No  wait  Perhaps I should sleep here so you don't miss Leonard as much  uh  ' cause you're being kind of a baby about it 
label1 One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight Drat  I'm never going to get to forty-three again  One  two  three  four Rats 
label2 Okay  bug report taken  Next time I will have a better plan for our evening's activity 
label2 Yeah  it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files  They faked the results 
label1 Honesty will never get us in 
label2 She's in 
label1 Look at that  that's a dent  Thank you  Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz  Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine / Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode ?
label1 And how do you propose to do that ?
label2 You're in your bedroom 
label2 Who else would it be ?
label2 Wha ' how did it get on the internet ?
label2 All right  let me rephrase the question  Why are you wearing long underwear ?
label1 Hello  Hello  Uh  uh  uh  four glasses of water  please  Anything for you guys ?
label2 Yes  I've always admired that about you 
label1 I know 
label1 It's been around for 25 years  and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers 
label1 Well  now I just feel silly holding it 
label1 Oh  everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt 
label1 It's bad enough I'm being taken against my will  I don't see why it has to be in some hippie's mobile sex dungeon 
label1 An actual real scientist 
label1 That's your badge of honour  your warrior's wound  if you will  I was wrong  minstrels will write songs about you 
label1 Haughty derision it is 
label2 Fine  Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system  phase one commencing 
label2 Sheldon  you know that if you stay up all night  you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow  And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon  And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon  Good night 
label1 My mistake  Now  assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present  that would bring the total up to 193 men  Plus or minus eight men 
label1 Well  if x equals the amount that you'll miss me  then I'll miss you x plus one 
label1 It would  but you know how much I admire preparedness  How did you know we'd be in the living room ?
label1 What ? You hold my hand  you kiss my mouth  but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever ? What happened to our love ?
label1 No ! Leonard  let me tell you something  Personal robots cannot get here soon enough 
label1 Well  make your jokes  but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return 
label1 Never mind  you won't get it right  I'd better come with you 
label2 They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat  Let's hope the lug nut expands 
label1 And how would I do that ?
label2 Better  Thanks 
label2 Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn't know how big he was gonna be 
label2 I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you 
label2 I'm turning it on  but just to shut you up 
label2 Would you please help us make a relationship agreement ? But one that's tailored to us  okay  we don't need a bathroom schedule 
label2 Look  maybe it is a long shot  but sometimes long shots happen  Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star  He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide  but with the help of The Force  he ' wow  I can feel you hating me right now 
label1 Fifteen years old  Dennis Kim is fifteen years old  and he's already correcting my work  Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to you know  that other guy 
label1 That's funny  because my father was not a very clever man 
label1 Oh  no  Not that  I  I understand the mechanics 
label1 Well it's a game of the imagination  Leonard  Paint a picture 
label1 And when you're at the gate ?
label1 Not now 
label1 Yeah ? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive ?
label1 What's wrong ?
label1 Gentlemen  I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me  I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners  From now on  when I make an assertion  I need you to challenge it 
label1 Fascinating  The only logical explanation is that this is a dream 
label1 Hello  Leonard  do you like my bongos ? Bet you didn't know that I had bongos 
label2 Nicely done  Howard 
label1 You want me to read a geology paper ?
label1 Do another one  do another one 
label2 That is amazing  How long have you been collecting ?
label2 Yes  I did 
label1 I'm calling it  I won 
label2 Cos it's not carved in stone 
label2 That's a relief 
label1 I haven't  I've been meaning to  but who has the time ?
label1 Challenge accepted 
label1 Oh ! Not this again 
label1 Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing  and it's now six oh eight  I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out ? and  uh  How are they hanging ?
label2 I kind of have other plans tonight 
label2 Yeah  but she also used to sleep with Zack 
label1 And rubber gloves  uh  air freshener  Um  noise-cancelling headphones  Oh  danger whistle  Um  pepper spray  Ooh  a multi-language occupied sign  Uh  let's see  we have seat protectors  uh  booties for my shoes  a clothespin for my nose  Oh  and a mirror on a stick  so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo 
label1 All right  What were the symptoms ?
label1 No  it did at first  but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia  and they really helped put things into perspective 
label1 All right  These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow  I need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand  Howard  look this over and tell me what's unclear to you 
label1 Oh  great  Now I'm worse than a fraud  I'm practically a biologist 
label2 You know  on some level  I've always believed that I don't deserve a woman like her 
label1 You did this  didn't you ?
label2 The bird's still there ?
label1 Yeah  And you never will  Ooh  hey  oh  ask her to do the tissue thing  Do it  ask her 
label2 I guess he just hates fun 
label2 Good  I'm glad 
label1 Oh  Hello  doggie  Nice doggie  I bet you think you smell hot dogs  Look  a cat !
label1 Ours doesn't need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator 
label2 Let's not jump to conclusions  A lot of things start with U 
label1 I'll be right back 
label1 Oh  I'll make English breakfast tea  They destroyed your culture  That's close enough  You know  I'm curious  why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man ?
label1 Ooh  perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation 
label2 Look at it  Non-alcoholic beer 
label1 Professor Hawking  it's an honour and a privilege to meet you  sir 
label2 Remember  uh  a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea ?
label1 ' Soft Kitty is for when you're sick  You're not sick 
label2 It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror  isn't it ?
label2 Hey  Howard ?
label1 I was going to mention it at the time  but then I thought  some day  this might be a teachable moment 
label1 Oh  God ! One  two  three !
label1 Professor Hawking 
label1 Well  she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory 
label2 The Fifth Annual East Rutherford  New Jersey  Gay  Lesbian  Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau 
label2 Yeah  okay  I see him  It looks like they're having a nice time  I wish I could hear what they're saying 
label2 Well  you should talk to Stuart 
label2 Come on  don't give him a hard time 
label2 Horse  but mostly just for the height  A little bit for the genital girth 
label2 I would have asked you  In my head  On the way home  While I was having a good cry 
label2 Why are you so mean to me ?
label2 Sorry  My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford  New Jersey 
label2 That tonight's gonna be a good night  and tonight's gonna be a good night  and tonight's gonna be a good  good night ! Tonight's the night  uh  uh  let's live it up  uh  I got my money  let's spend it up '
label1 Play through the pain 
label2 Were you seeing other men ?
label2 How could you lose that ?
label1 Maybe  maybe not  Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world 
label2 You're gonna put alcohol in the punch ?
label2 So  if you don't like this Christie  why are you letting her stay ?
label2 Really ? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw ?
label1 Why should I ? She knows that I don't like Christmas  and yet  every year  she forces me to celebrate it  Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will  at the Christmas tree lot  there was mistletoe  and she kissed me under it in public  Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show 
label1 Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion ?
label1 That's a wise policy  I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest  Got a terrible case of pinkeye  But luckily  I was going as a zombie  I won second place 
label1 Tears seem appropriate  Enlargement of the heart muscle  or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure 
label1 You make sissy on your belt buckles ? Mee-Maw's forks never had that 
label1 You're embarrassing yourself 
label2 You know what's a cool name ? Angelo  That has angel and jell-o in it 
label1 Who knows ? I haven't watched any scary movies recently  I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe  And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull 
label1 Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me  How might we examine this more closely ?
label2 Relatively modern  Why  what are you wearing ?
label1 How do you know this isn't a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police ?
label2 Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks 
label1 Oh  there  well  look  there's all kinds of videos 
label1 So ? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box ?
label1 I want grilled cheese 
label1 So we get to have a scene with him ?
label2 We had that idea years ago  How come we never did anything with it ?
label2 She doesn't like you  Um  well  uh  you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on  so '
label2 Where do you stand on it ?
label1 He still hasn't responded  What's taking him so long ?
label1 Hang on  Physics Today mentioned the paper 
label2 Okay ' I just ' I kind of '
label1 How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties ?
label1 Oh  Well  a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature 
label2 I don't know  The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler's List is tough to beat 
label1 Cluck  cluck  cluck  What are we  ladies at a quilting bee ? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town ?
label2 I'm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist  What would I say is wrong with me ?
label1 Maybe you're right 
label1 What do you mean ?
label1 It's the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt 
label1 Well  isn't this nice  Sometimes the baby wins 
label2 Yeah  that's great  you guys want corn dogs ?
label2 Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow 
label2 Huh ? If you think that's cheesy  buckle up  Penny Hofstadter  will you please stay married to me ?
label1 Well  I don't think you have a shot there  I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs  Now  given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability 
label1 That does it  I'm getting uranium 
label2 Howard  just come in here 
label2 Glaringly obvious  Go on 
label1 What is that ?
label1 Because I'm a fraud  No  I purport to be a man of the mind  I've been such a  a vocal champion of the singularity  but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away ?
label1 Hard as this may be to believe  it's possible that I'm not boyfriend material 
label1 Just look  I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team  The colours are based on Star Trek  the original series  The three of you will wear support red  and I will wear command gold 
label1 Meemaw resisted at first  but now she loves it 
label2 You would go to a beach house ?
label1 Excuse me  You're not supposed to be enjoying this 
label1 Not really 
label1 You know  I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative  but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn 
label1 But I feel like I could reach out and touch you 
label2 I'm on it  15 years from now  we'll make guacamole together 
label1 You don't need an Iron Man helmet  You're not Iron Man 
label2 How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles ? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets  The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town  The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you'd started growing again 
label1 Interesting  Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal  And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport 
label1 May I come in ?
label1 What does it say ?
label1 I need a growth medium  and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt  Here  swab my throat 
label1 I am  Oh  Wait 
label1 Double Stuf ?
label1 A little 
label1 Oh  that's a rather earthy cologne  My uncle used to wear that  Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns 
label1 All right  goodbye 
label2 Two for thirty  And you come to my birthday party 
label2 Sheldon  sit down 
label1 I caused that fight  I feel terrible  Wait  I can do that better  I caused that fight  I feel terrible  Yeah  wow  I don't know which one I like more 
label1 Oh  of course  Um  is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform ?
label2 Oh  sorry  This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9000 miles away 
label1 A hybrid dog and octopus  Man's underwater best friend 
label2 How can 5 not be worse than 1 ?
label2 I know 
label1 Oh  dear 
label1 ldon : Are you asking me or telling me ?
label1 It's not that big of an opportunity  And even if Hawking's theories are correct  all they prove is where the universe came from  why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be  I mean  me ? I'm interested in the big questions 
label2 There's a sniper  use your rocket launcher 
label2 Oh  Pass 
label1 Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space  So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic 
label1 Leonard  the TV is in the building  we've been denied access to the building  ergo we are done 
label2 I haven't heard from Sheldon in a while  You think he's okay ?
label1 Oh  Well  suit yourself  Who wants to check me ?
label1 How can you sleep ? I'm not done making you feel better  I still have to put a cold rag on your head  sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest 
label2 Okay  I have pokh 
label1 I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures 
label2 I can't hear you  I'm in the shower 
label2 nard : Oh  Right 
label1 I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you  I'd somehow be unburdened 
label1 Although  sometimes  she omits the veil entirely 
label2 Well  you know  It's easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you  because your love  it's like a river  It's peaceful and deep  Your soul is  it's like a secret that I could never keep 
label1 Of course I'm busy 
label1 Here  drink slash eat this 
label1 That was a lot of puppies 
label2 nard : Does that really need to be in the agreement ?
label1 Morning 
label1 Of course I'm doing laundry  Saturday night is laundry night  and I'm in a laundry room  so  I believe your inference is justified 
label2 Come on  guys  push 
label1 Actually  I meant you could drive me  But if it makes you happy  that other stuff  too 
label2 Well  it's always me  take one for the team 
label2 He just won't listen to me 
label1 Well  I was thinking about you helping me out last night
label1 All right  what we need now is a tactical retreat  Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth's Athens and Sparta ? Not important  Leonard  Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away  Howard will cover us 
label2 Hello  Mrs  Latham  Yes  I live with him  I don't  I  I really don't know why  Tonight ? Sure  that'd be great  Okay  I'll  I'll see you then  Bye  She wants to have dinner and talk about my research 
label2 Feel like driving to Arizona with me ?
label2 Um  I'm not sure 
label1 Howard  if you're going to lie to your wife  don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood  That's a dead giveaway 
label2 I know  I was hoping to go without anyone finding out 
label1 Great  Tropicana  no pulp 
label1 I'm sick  thank you very much 
label2 So we made you an appointment  and we want you to keep it 
label2 It's actually pretty common in our field  There's not much you can do about it 
label1 What's a hickey ?
label1 I hardly think so  You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes  bees  bears  snakes  possums  poison oak  oh  and last  but not least  teenagers with guitars 
label1 No  that can't be it  And since you seem to have forgotten  the reason we live together is we're best friends  And I got your back  Jack 
label2 Green Lantern 
label2 Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon ?
label1 I like The Transformers  Do you like The Transformers ?
label2 All right  let's  let's do couples  I want to 
label1 I'm so disappointed in myself  Jealousy is completely illogical 
label1 And Amy doesn't look sick 
label1 Well I'm sorry  It's not my fault  I'm just incredibly smart  and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks  Oh  now  don't you start crying  You get in that spaceship  Mommy's late for Indian bingo 
label1 Well  it's a new day  I have a new outlook  You know  I realized I don't need to worry about other people  I just need to think more about myself 
label2 Oh  I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed  I let your head hit the wall and I laughed 
label1 Will you please play the game ? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us 
label1 Someone will show 
label2 What happened ?
label1 Then buckle up  you're in for a cranky night 
label2 Really ?
label1 Did I ? Well  that can't be right  No one's ever done that before  Except me  because I just did it  Sheldon and his brain  yeah  Sheldon and his brain  yeah  Sheldon and his brain  yeah  Sheldon and his brain  yeah  Sheldon and his brain '
label1 You said be nice to Penny  I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice 
label1 Oh  Doctor Hofstadter  it's so good to see you again 
label1 Hmm ? Oh  no  no  no  They're from many famous people  See ? Oh  like this one  This is from Patrick Stewart  It says if I come to his house again  I get to meet his dogs  Oh  excuse me 
label2 Hold on  hold on  So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25 % ?
label1 Excuse me  Here  look up fun  get back to me 
label1 Okay  I see  so not a DVD burner 
label2 Oh  no  it's 6:30 in the morning 
label2 You know what ? Why don't we just ease into this  Let  let's go for a walk and  and  and see if we find a new restaurant 
label1 Thank you 
label2 Because you do this kind of thing all the time  and then you try to cover it up 
label1 Yes  And if there's time  take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing 
label2 You're thirty years old and you live with your mother 
label1 All right  my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed 
label2 I'm trying  but I'm judging 
label1 Okay  But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison 
label1 Sssshhhh ! Penny's sleeping 
label2 Why a turtle ?
label2 Before I come in  you should know  I have gas 
label1 Interesting  Not body parts that usually team up  What about environmental factors ? Describe the scene for me 
label2 It was nice  you know  A lot of people showed up  told some great stories about him  Did you know that Arthur's son is a high school sci ' ?
label1 Leonard  I platonically love you  man  but face it  you're a mess 
label2 You lie down  he'll be here in a minute 
label2 No  it doesn't 
label2 Geez  I never realized you were so competitive 
label1 My catapult flings my bishop to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two 
label2 That's not a bad idea 
label1 Oh  Oh  Lord  that multiplication error ! He thought he carried the one  But he didn't 
label2 Come here  Tell you a secret ?
label2 What about
label1 Excuse me  I take care of him 
label2 Nice little bot you've got here 
label1 I'll sit over there  it looks cleaner 
label1 He does it all the time  He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness 
label1 It's hard to say 
label1 I'm not sure  it could go either way 
label2 Thank you  I'll see you at work 
label1 All right  Leonard fairly calls the question  who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him ? Say hi to Kurt for us 
label2 Okay  let me put it this way  in your entire life  how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party 
label1 Well  we had dinner  uh  played some games  and then I spent the night  Oh  you'll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits 
label2 It's not that big a deal  You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine 
label1 Now that you're in my debt  please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party 
label1 And in that future  are we on the same planet ? Because I've seen people make the long-distance thing work 
label1 Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual  You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought  tedious research  sleepless nights filled with indecision  I  haven't I lost enough today ?
label2 Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back 
label1 Forgive me your highness  for I am but a monkey  and it is in my nature to climb  I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair 
label2 Okay  Mom  you sit over there 
label1 This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix 
label1 Coming 
label2 Sheldon  what do you think you're doing ?
label1 Perhaps you're getting a brain tumour 
label2 Well  maybe not  but some day we actually will be old  and we'll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had 
label2 Thank you 
label1 I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them 
label1 I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today  It  it was unnecessary  This is warm  Oh  and also  I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule 
label2 They sell out incredibly fast  but as long as one of us gets in  we can buy passes '
label1 But this is my birthday suit  Are you having a stroke ? Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party 
label2 Who is he ?
label2 Hey  great 
label2 Oh  yeah  You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing 
label2 Really ?
label2 Sure  So  are we doing this ?
label1 I'm fine  Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder 
label2 I'm proud of you 
label1 I think metaphorically  But he was in the bathroom for a while 
label1 ldon : No  this is my room  People don't go in my room 
label2 How so ?
label2 Mm-hmm  Yep  I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood 
label1 All right  now  before you enter my bedroom unescorted  I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement  Easement  It's a legal right
label1 That's outrageous  This is our idea based on our research  How can you possibly justify owning a majority share ?
label1 Really  how does it work ?
label2 Would you just look inside ?
label1 Oh  there you are  Just so you know  I was up all night  but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement 
label2 Have they found a match for you ?
label1 Oh no  Morlocks ? Eat him  eat him  Aaaaargh 
label2 What are you doing ?
label1 Leonard 
label1 There's a cucumber in my water 
label1 Excuse me  spoiler alert 
label2 Still  I'd like to know the details  His mother was human  his father was Vulcan  they couldn't just conceive 
label2 I love you 
label1 You can  I'm happy when you come home  And I'm scared of fireworks  By the way  on July Fourth  we're all sleeping here 
label1 Now  who would do that ?
label2 This is not a good time 
label2 No  we're not going to Long Beach 
label2 Uh  let's see  Uh  I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech  most of my research is with high-powered lasers  and  oh  I've just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles 
label1 Oh  really ? Since meeting her  what have been your greatest accomplishments ?
label2 Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton ? I am a huge fan of hers !
label1 I got lost 
label1 You know  that doesn't work for me  let's stay with Mrs  Cooper 
label2 Why are you saying we have marital problems ? We don't have marital problems 
label2 You're leaving ?
label2 I think you look fantastic 
label1 What are you smiling at ?
label2 That's not bad  Howard ' Rocket Man ' Wolowitz 
label1 I'm sorry  so  eventually  zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is ?
label2 Sheldon  you don't give your mother enough credit  She's warm  she's loving  she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training 
label1 Oh  but I'm not going home  It's Wednesday  Wednesday is new comic book day  we have to go to the comic book store  And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation  it's creamy tomato soup day  and Radio Shack  there's a sale on triple-a batteries  Plus  we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets 
label2 Nope  Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring 
label1 Well  apparently  I was wrong  Congratulations 
label2 It's not that simple  What am I supposed to say ? Penny  do you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again ?
label2 Two hundred 
label1 Yeah  My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure  I also have the other kind of will  and in it I will my Wil back to Wil 
label2 Yeah  I got a dressmaker's mannequin  I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm  and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back 
label1 Well  that seems like a snooze  Even for public radio 
label2 No  I'm fine with it 
label1 Yes  From here on in  I've decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice  thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best  enlighten and amaze  Page 14  item seven 
label1 Yeah  well  I understand that I'm half naked  but there is a reasonable explanation  While I slept in my sleeper car  all my possessions were stolen  Now  typically  I wear pyjamas  but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man  I'll have you know  Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him  My good man  now  before you walk away  I know that I may appear deranged  but I am  in fact  a world-renowned physicist  Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion  Go ahead  ask  Bosons have integer spin  fermions have half-integer spin  My legs are getting cold  Why won't anybody help me ?
label1 Well  that's not fair  We should all get plaques 
label1 How come I never get to do anything I want to do ?
label2 I've got my helm of lordly might  my boots of speed  and if things get too exciting  my inhaler of asthma 
label1 How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels ?
label2 I don't know what to do  I mean  the paper's terrible  But if I tell her  she'll know that I read it and she'll get really mad 
label2 Listen  we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch  or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules 
label1 Amy  I don't understand  are we broken up or not ? It's like you can't make up your mind 
label1 Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war 
label1 It's been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you 
label1 Level three and she thinks she's rich ! What a noob 
label1 Waterfalls  Crashing waves  Babbling brooks 
label1 Will you at least go with me to the restroom here  so you can open the door and flush the urinal ?
label2 Sheldon  I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment 
label2 Stop ! Stop it ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop it !
label2 I don't know 
label1 I see  I own nine pairs of underpants 
label1 You're tying my hands here 
label1 What'd you get ? What'd you get ?
label2 You think that'd help ?
label1 So what ? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter 
label1 Oh  please  Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics 
label1 You  you dirty birdie  I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday  and I realized I'm deeply offended  Now  be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms 
label1 Are you sure ? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving  it makes noise 
label2 I'll give you a hint  We're watching Daredevil 
label1 You can never be too careful  I got one last year before I went to Epcot 
label1 See  this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting 
label1 Didn't work out well 
label2 Are you hungry  thirsty ? Can I offer you anything ?
label2 Oh  Huh  um  maybe  if you like women who are tall ' and perfect 
label2 Well  it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase  I can tell you that 
label2 Well  funny story  So  we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder  but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead '
label1 I don't want to  But it looks like you left me no choice 
label1 I sense I may have crossed some sort of line 
label2 Well  roomie  it's only one night a week  but it's a start 
label1 Actually  you can't have that one either  It's too good  Sorry 
label2 Oh  I don't know  Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend  you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed 
label1 Here goes nothing ? This is the initial test of our prototype  Can we give it a little more gravitas ?
label2 Move out 
label1 And that is the answer to the question  what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory ?
label2 So you're not going to see her again ?
label2 Just a minute  This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day 
label2 It's harder than I thought 
label1 But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you 
label1 Well  you seem hot under the collar  or is that the sweater ?
label2 Keep going 
label2 Really ? I've never done that before  Does it work ?
label1 After much deliberation  we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet  They don't shed fur  they don't make noise 
label1 Is that your final decision ?
label2 That is a problem 
label1 I have real problems here  Amy  I can't be mollified with a beverage designed for children  Mmm  yummy 
label1 No  it's not 
label2 Not too bad  Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette ?
label1 Professor Hawking ?
label1 Open the mail !
label1 Because you want to start watching it right now  Copy that  Let's see  Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu  Well  get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan 
label1 Want me to sing it again ?
label2 So  what do you say ?
label1 This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton  by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say 
label1 Whoa  whoa ! Now you're making fun of my bona fides ?
label2 In love yet ?
label2 No  no  You gave me an explanation  it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers 
label1 I don't know  Lately we've been talking about converting it into a missile silo 
label1 My mom bought me those pants 
label1 Careful  it's addictive 
label2 I was thinking we could work on this at night  and then maybe in a couple of weeks  we'll have ourselves an app to sell 
label1 I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing  Although  I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object 
label1 It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up  Wait here  I'll find us seats 
label1 I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits 
label2 I don't know
label1 You bet your sweet B I won't 
label2 Oh  come on  you know you're overreacting 
label1 Honestly  I've been better  Do you have time ? Leonard says you're very busy these days 
label2 So what's going on with you two ?
label2 Exactly  And  you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring 
label2 Yes  he is 
label1 You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me 
label2 Good  Because I've loved you since the moment we met  and I will keep loving you until the end of time 
label2 Hmm  Priya's not back yet ? Well  I guess that's not unusual  women  men  the whole sitting  standing deal  so  what are we talking about ?
label1 Zip it pip it  Can I have your phone number ?
label2 Yeah  sure  that might be fun 
label2 Thank you  Amy  Very touching  Howard and Bernadette  you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other  And that's the strongest kind of love because at its core  it has kindness  patience  and respect  Qualities that are hard to find in people these days 
label2 You've had an acting job where you got paid ?
label1 So  if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard  why on earth would she guzzle a witches brew of his soda and spit ?
label2 I don't know  Tell her I'm sick 
label1 Yes  I was in a taxi  but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license  so I leapt out and ran for it 
label1 Thank you  And while you're thinking about it  if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season  I can practically guarantee your death 
label1 Amy's sick 
label1 Oh  I've been meaning to tell you  I figured out your magic trick 
label2 I played that pretty well 
label2 Fine  but don't expect my help 
label1 It's 7:05 
label1 How can one person be a whole movie ?
label2 Yeah  Turns out  they guard the iPods  but they don't guard the shirts 
label2 That's really nice  Sheldon  I'm happy for you 
label1 I thought I just did 
label1 I'll be happy to check the math  but numbers don't lie  Penny  In any event  now that Amy and I have spent quality time together  I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship 
label1 Just like Schrodinger's Cat  your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad  It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is 
label1 Oh  jiminy  that's cold 
label1 Can't happen  We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me 
label2 I'm not glowing  I'm upset 
label1 Show me your citrus peels  Gei wo kan  ni jud di zi pei  Show me your citrus peels  Gei wo kan  ni jud di zi pei  Show me your '
label2 There's gotta be something else we could try 
label1 Oh ! I don't usually pick up on those things  Good for me 
label2 Oh  come on  This is stupid 
label1 He's a Hobbit ! I've got your back 
label1 And be a social pariah ? Oh  you know that's not my style 
label1 I erotically caress your
label2 Whatever  Sheldon  I'm exhausted  I'm not taking you to the dentist 
label2 It is actually  In fact  I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together 
label2 Sure  Black  right ?
label2 That one over there 
label2 Uh  that  that's not necessary 
label2 Oh  hey  Stuart  This is Penny  She's looking for some comic books 
label2 Oh  boo-hoo  I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon  What is that ?
label1 Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert  code red the computer worm  or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew ?
label2 I'm always excited for you  I'm excited that you found this new job where you're making decent money 
label2 Penny  I've always known I loved you  but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you  Thank you for saying yes 
label1 I was hesitant the first time I tried it  but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins  It's quite satisfying 
label1 Okay  step four  Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser ?
label2 Funny expression  sleep tight  It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally ' sleep tight 
label1 Old comic book  I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box 
label2 May what ?
label1 Or that's complete poppycock which Amy made up  It still could be the map 
label2 You just called dibs 
label1 Ah  it's just like he's here 
label2 You're in a good mood 
label2 No  I meant '  never mind  Hey  check it out  I got you a Batman cookie jar !
label2 That's actually my napkin 
label2 I think Sheldon really misses Amy 
label1 Why hast thou forsaken me  O deity whose existence I doubt ?
label1 Eh  why ? My spot  your spot  what difference does it make ?
label1 You're going to leave me ?
label2 Oh  yeah 
label2 Boy  you suck 
label2 Hey  I mean  it's been a little tough  but Penny's following her dreams  and in my book  that is not depressing 
label2 No  Steve Patterson told me 
label2 This is the movie that big soda doesn't want you to see 
label1 I feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor  Why'd you stop ?
label1 Oh  I understand the confusion  I have never said that you are not good at what you do  It's just that what you do is not worth doing 
label1 Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce ?
label2 Well  how about if we don't think about this as a relationship ? It could be more like a new version of software  Penny and Leonard 20  We can test it internally  shake out the bugs  and if we both feel it's solid  then we'll roll it out to the public 
label1 You initialed it  See ? L  H   L  H   L  H 
label2 Dad  you remember Sheldon 
label2 Okay  sorry 
label2 Yeah  It's a deviated septum  The surgery to correct it is simple  He's gonna do it next week 
label2 Wait  Sheldon's going to be there ? We all promised we weren't going to go 
label1 All right 
label1 I had a hundred and one fever  If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones  when is ?
label1 And I have the soulful eyes of a cow 
label2 If he were  I wouldn't be 
label1 A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend  She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend 
label2 Actually  I think it's more of wool  fire ant blend 
label1 While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots 
label1 A good question 
label2 Leave it alone  That's my girlfriend 
label1 It's hard to say  I've never really lived by myself  What if I become strange and eccentric ?
label1 Oh  actually  I would 
label2 Raj  we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team 
label1 I'm  I'm sorry ; I didn't realize you were on a date 
label1 Yeah  I think so  I just restocked the old PRK 
label2 Movies  yes 
label1 As usual  you're all wrong  The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam 
label2 Refresh my memory  Why didn't I just put you in the trunk ?
label2 Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified 
label2 No  we play Rock Band on our X-Box 
label1 If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning  I think I can face a simple award ceremony 
label2 I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault 
label1 You'll never believe it  Leonard gave me the most incredible gift  a trip to a historic railway  and I get to operate an actual locomotive 
label2 A dolphin might 
label2 We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West  so we followed him 
label2 Want some Chinese food ?
label1 Then we're probably okay 
label1 Hey  uh  Bernadette  let's test this theory  What do you think I'm feeling right now ?
label2 Sheldon  don't ruin the game 
label1 I wasn't talking to you 
label2 Come on  Howard  Bernadette  you're both scientists  Help me out here 
label1 You're Kirk  I'm Spock  Wolowitz is Scotty  Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed  and now we've got McCoy 
label1 Okay  first  talking to you while you're on the toilet isn't exactly a picnic for me either  okay ? Remember  when you can hear me  I can hear you  And second  you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me  It's  it's like  a  an itch in my brain I can't scratch 
label2 He's in his bedroom 
label1 It's culturally universal  a bed  even a temporary bed  is always oriented with the headboard away from the door  It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders 
label2 Is that nice ?
label2 I almost died !
label2 How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying ?
label1 Oh  good  Then you won't be disappointed 
label1 Someone will show 
label1 Well  I have and it will knock your socks off ! Good luck getting them back on 
label1 Oh  that's a paradox  I mean if you meant what you just said  then that means you may not have meant what you just said 
label1 I would've preferred to have you there with me 
label2 I might kill him right now 
label2 Thank you  What did he say ?
label2 Hey  a toast  Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project  And please know that we could not have done it without you  so cheers 
label2 Hello Penny 
label2 Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself  I always had to earn it 
label2 Just extending the intimacy  Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower ?
label2 You want to prepare him ? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself 
label2 Okay  Sheldon  I am out of options  Video store owner  Nursis Manookian  has no next of kin 
label1 No  No  No  This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia 
label2 Penny  as a scientist  my job is to figure out why things happen  But I don't think I'll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you  You know  maybe I don't
label2 So what ? It's the same food 
label2 What's going on ?
label1 But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research 
label2 No  That's not what he meant 
label2 Hey  ready for lunch ?
label1 Well  I haven't  And while they say never meet your heroes  I just don't see how I could disappoint  Who would you choose ?
label1 And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class ?
label1 Semiotics  The study of signs and symbols  it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics 
label1 That's a bit childish  isn't it ?
label1 They should  It's one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival 
label1 Sonny and Cher made it work  Their variety show kept going long after the divorce  and here we are still talking about them 
label2 You know what  why don't you just do it ? You'll go have fun for a few weeks  make some money  and who knows what it might lead to ?
label2 We finished the experiment early  so I thought I'd come home and surprise you 
label2 That's a lot less big 
label2 Does it bother you ?
label1 I'm familiar with everything  but go on 
label1 You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins 
label1 Yes  in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it 
label1 This is a Bunsen burner  I'm a scientist  I know what I'm doing  Oh  drat 
label2 Because you were being selfish 
label1 No  that measuring cup has always been for urine 
label2 Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ?
label1 I hear a woman's voice 
label1 Yes  Must be killing you wondering who  Fine  I'll tell you  Stuart from the comic bookstore  Barry Kripke from the university  Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack and TV's LeVar Burton 
label2 All right  Sheldon  if you need me to take you to the dentist  I will take you to the dentist 
label1 Well  I'm not sure I have a dominant leg  They're both pretty submissive 
label1 The Jewish people 
label1 Oh  where are we going ?
label1 Three-headed lion 
label1 I don't understand my food  Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco 
label1 I did  How was yours ?
label1 If I can interject here  obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate 
label2 You know what  I'm happy that Penny's moving on  It gives me the freedom to move on myself 
label2 Wait  if you guys didn't talk  what did you ' never mind  stupid question 
label2 I understand that we're under contract  and I don't know what the consequences of violating that are  but  uh  we're not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised 
label2 Sheldon  relax 
label2 Then he and I are on equal ground 
label2 Look  even if it's not him  Amy's probably going to date someone at some point 
label2 That's the thing  you can't  I'll be on a ship in the North Sea 
label2 What's all this ?
label1 You're blowing it  We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him 
label1 All right 
label2 nard : If people don't go in there  and you're people  and ' You are people  aren't you ? Making a joke 
label2 All we have to do is rig up a 3 - D communication system 
label2 Yup  I told him if he didn't bite the hygienist  I'd take him for ice cream 
label2 Yeah  It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened 
label1 I reject them all 
label2 That's it  It's Sheldon's bedtime  he is in for the night 
label1 I really have no idea  I don't particularly excel at reading facial expressions  body language '
label1 Oh  yes  I just discovered I don't have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition  so you and I are going to perform a full backup  reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems 
label2 I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here 
label2 He's practicing 
label1 Professor Hawking 
label1 I hope you're happy making me read this  Bert's work is remarkable  and I'm more upset than ever  This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining 
label1 You mean the myofascial point ?
label2 You let a guy sit on me 
label2 Oh  right  Ladies and gentlemen  our guest of honour  Dr  Sheldon Cooper 
label1 But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda 
label1 Focus  Leonard  focus ! The heat of battle is upon us  the dogs of war are unleashed 
label2 I am looking at you 
label2 Well  I can't read your mind  Penny !
label1 Thank you 
label2 Oh  that's pretty steep 
label1 Well  then it's settled 
label1 Wrong  Obesity 
label2 You're kidding  3 - D ?
label1 Oh  Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing ?
label2 Ah  don't  If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds  they shouldn't have started a sci-fi channel 
label2 Here we go 
label2 What is it ?
label2 Neat  Good work  Sheldon  we've got to call this off 
label1 I was talking with Penny 
label1 And you said the party starts at seven 
label1 Yes  but it's like you're right here in the room 
label1 I am fine  Here  eat your toast 
label1 Well  then  you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots 
label2 I don't  look  you know  words don't always have to mean things 
label1 Alright  Goodnight 
label1 No  He died when I was 14 
label1 Is that really what you want to talk about  Leonard ?
label1 It's a terrific book  I've distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process 
label1 I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal 
label2 So are our laptops 
label1 He is a born showman 
label1 Yeah  well  you're an engineer  End of joke  burn 
label1 More wrong ? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation 
label2 Oh  I love those 
label2 What are you doing here ?
label1 Hello  home wrecker 
label1 I'm checking for musical instruments  Does that sound like castanets to you ?
label2 You know what I mean  could you just give us a little privacy ?
label1 Stand by for my upcoming tat 
label2 Yep  Here's some money 
label1 It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny 
label1 My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty 
label2 You were right 
label1 Thank you  And what is my function as wingman ?
label1 Yeah  good for you  and don't stop working on it 
label1 So what'd you think ?
label1 Oh  I have a feeling that once you start  you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop 
label1 Do you speak Klingon ?
label2 Great  Your mom's not coming  right ?
label1 Yeah  I have to say  I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition  Apparently  there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop 
label2 Um  I'm okay with you driving my car  I'm not okay with you flying my car 
label1 Well of course I oh ! Yeah  I have an idea  let's throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party 
label1 Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow 
label2 Yeah  we all are 
label2 This is ridiculous  You're just making stuff up 
label2 He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater 
label2 nard : When I have to 
label2 When you say mistake  do you mean a fortunate mistake  like the discovery of penicillin ?
label1 Yes  but the actual results are unsuccessful and I've already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man's understanding of the universe 
label1 Really ? I didn't see you draw one from your quiver 
label1 But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go 
label1 The first forty-three parallel universes I've checked proved to be empty  I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different 
label1 Oh  you're welcome 
label2 It's only for five weeks 
label1 First off  that is axiomatically wrong  because the best pudding is chocolate  Secondly  the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death  It is extracted from the plant '
label2 What ? Why ?
label1 Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table ?
label2 Oh  I hope it's just a sprain  I cannot walk into that E  R  with another video game injury 
label1 Straightening up 
label2 Do you realise that if Penny wakes up  there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here ?
label2 I  um  I don't follow 
label2 Why don't we go get the food for the party 
label1 I believe I've made some progress on our ground rules 
label1 Yes  That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind  He ceases his fruitless efforts  he donates his body to scientific research  and he waits to die 
label2 Yeah  why ?
label2 Okay  well  thanks for sharing with us  Good night 
label1 So to answer your question  no  it's not better 
label1 Yes  If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window  Please don't come to my funeral  Have a good night 
label1 There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer 
label1 I can't sleep  how are you going ?
label2 It's probably for the best  For a lot of these guys  the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets 
label2 Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again ?
label1 Amy  I was off by a factor of 10000 
label2 Yes  I feel terrible about it  I will never forgive myself  I don't expect you to either  and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance 
label1 I'm concerned about Amy  She's acting a bit odd lately 
label2 Yeah  it's like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice 
label2 Raj  what are you doing ?
label2 Sorry  I panicked 
label2 Trust me  call her 
label1 She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment  I have no choice but to assume the worst  given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions 
label1 Yeah  okay  I can see you're going to take this the wrong way  Let me try again  Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps 
label1 My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny 
label1 Okay  I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time  I just had to be sure 
label1 Wo de zhing shi Sheldon 
label1 It's all right  I'll see it again with you 
label2 I came home with no pants 
label2 It sounds like either way  I finally get some rest 
label1 That's not very nice 
label2 Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite ?
label1 Well  just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend  I stand at the ready 
label1 Well  first of all  you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation 
label2 Well  you're about to be in an even better one  I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure  but  I've been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it  Your element does not exist 
label2 Okay  he's in the bathroom  let's go 
label2 It's also a problem because we don't even know if the aliens who find this can see  I mean  they might communicate in a totally different way than us 
label1 I don't need a vacation 
label2 If there was a hidden compartment  don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now ?
label2 Well  there's Joyce Kim  but she defected back to North Korea so it's a little geographically undesireable 
label1 Oh  Well  I feel both flattered and hurt  Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas 
label1 I don't drink coffee 
label2 ' We took the red-eye 
label2 I got it  I got it  Listen  um  I think there's been a misunderstanding  See  Penny is my fianc'e 
label1 Doesn't matter  This is no way to make new humans  People coming out of people  It's some kind of dirty magic show 
label1 Oh  President Siebert  I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office 
label2 Okay  I did not want to do this but  I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek : The Next Generation Geordi LaForge  without his visor in the original packaging  If you do not get out of my way  I will open it 
label1 Okay  Does that planet have to be Earth ?
label1 You take it easy ! I need to use your shower 
label2 Oh  crap  What are we gonna do ?
label1 I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen  I'm nauseated and feverish  I believe I may have cholera 
label2 I thought we were going to play Halo tonight 
label2 You mean  are you talking gaming marathon ?
label2 Here  let me try  Call McFlono McFloonyloo  Heh-heh 
label1 Amy  the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way 
label2 What do you mean  you're moving out ? Why ?
label1 No  I had a date with a proper education  Instead of a tuxedo  I dressed myself in good habits  Instead of spiked punch  I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge  Instead of dancing in a gym  I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms '
label2 You're right  I'm sorry  Let's watch the game 
label2 Oh  please  we've spent our whole lives running away from fights  Personally  I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size 
label2 No  what's disgusting is he's still keeping track 
label2 Me ? Well  how am I supposed to fix it ?
label1 No  you !
label1 I'm sorry  Yes  of course 
label2 Okay  let's try it this way  Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said ' what was that ? What did you say ? Oh  yes  you said you owed me one 
label1 I think I know 
label2 Well  flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one 
label2 You betrayed us for money  who are you ?
label1 It was  I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash 
label2 Oh he's trying to make a new friend 
label2 Putting them on 
label2 Mm-hmm 
label1 See  that's funny because '
label1 They were out of scones 
label1 I'm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all 
label2 Hmm  I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond 
label2 Sheldon  Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope 
label1 Which reminds me  This came in the mail  and I want you to have it 
label1 You said quantum coupling  That made me think of the show Quantum Leap  That's a tangent and it's your fault 
label2 I  well  I see her around  I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude 
label2 Oh  uh  yeah  I got ' em on Amazon 
label1 If there's ever a Church of Sheldon  this will be when it started  Ow !
label1 Wow  Pouting and running away actually worked  I must say  that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me  So  um  what is the solution ?
label1 Then how can I say it convincingly ?
label1 Ugh  Stuart 
label2 Well  the G stands for graphics  That's a hard G  so I'd say gif 
label2 What are you talking about ?
label2 Look  I admit it  I may have crossed a line here  but come on  Raj  your sister is a grown woman  To her  I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate 
label2 Morning  Sheldon 
label2 I haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie 
label1 Perhaps you'd prefer this one  The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all  because it haseight legs and two body parts 
label2 Well  now you're making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location 
label1 Finally  something breaks our way 
label2 Okay  I don't know  it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller  Oh  um  if you could help out with me and my girlfriend  She's all the way in India  That would be great 
label1 I'm not hitting on her 
label1 Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles 
label1 Do you understand how important Hawking is to me ? When I was six years old  I dressed up as him for Halloween 
label1 Quantum physics makes me so happy 
label2 Come on  Dennis  I'll show you the radiation lab 
label1 And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control 
label1 Agreed 
label1 Oh  yes  In fact  I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion  You bowl like your mama  Unless  of course  she bowls well  In which case  you bowl nothing like her 
label2 Let me guess  you want it 
label1 All right  will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home is inarguably the best ?
label1 I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack 
label2 Yeah  really 
label2 Sheldon  you are one day late for your haircut 
label2 Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan ?
label1 Then no 
label2 I earned this  Back off 
label2 Not always  but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon  I get worried 
label2 And we can just put this whole thing behind us 
label2 Yeah  we're examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector 
label2 Sure  You're living here for free  I guess I owe you 
label1 What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me ?
label1 They took our TV  two laptops  four external hard-drives  our PS2  our PS3  our X-Box  our X-Box 360  our classic Nintendo  our Super Nintendo  our Nintendo 64 and our Wii 
label1 Oh  that was no joke  But I understand your confusion as I am our group's resident cut-up 
label1 I'm starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid 
label1 Hey  sweet ride 
label1 You okay ?
label2 They slept together  Sherlock 
label2 I wet the bed until college  but I don't think that's a quality fix 
label2 Exactly  They say it finally solves the submarine controversy 
label2 That should have been my first clue 
label1 I'm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away 
label2 Ow ! Ow !
label2 I've always been a little confused about this  Why don't Hindus eat beef ?
label2 That was odd 
label2 Sheldon  you're not in charge  It's my idea  I'm in charge 
label2 No  no  I think it'll be great  Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work  she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes  Giant baby 
label2 No  we're kind of taking it slow 
label2 Uh  she's my mother  You know her ?
label2 I love it 
label1 I got my job back 
label1 I was valedictorian and expected to give an address  Even now  I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd  There must have been thousands of people  My heart started pounding in my chest  I began to hyperventilate  My vision became blurry  and before I knew it oh  dear 
label2 Really  ' cos you don't look like you're swelling up at all  maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home 
label1 Raj  Raj  she's got me cornered  cover me 
label2 No problem  Welcome home 
label1 I know what your point is  You're intimidated by Amy's intellect  To that I say  buck up 
label2 What is it ?
label1 It's in her book  Needy Baby  Greedy Baby 
label1 No  Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended 
label1 I'm sorry  did I wake you ?
label1 What's wrong with it ?
label1 Yes  And now  I can't make any promises  but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot 
label2 He keeps emergency Purell in the car 
label1 Oh  not at all  I've had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening  and  oh  I had lunch
label1 Thanks  Oh  Great party 
label2 We do seem to keep finding room mates 
label2 I wouldn't 
label2 Oh  the video game  Yeah  that was bad 
label2 You think it's time you apologize to her yourself ?
label1 Don't laugh  she wasn't joking 
label1 This is not my laundry 
label2 I think I've made my point 
label2 Howard  do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser ? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility 
label1 Hello  female children  Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist  Polish-born  French-educated Madame Curie  Co-discoverer of radioactivity  she was a hero of science  until her hair fell out  her vomit and stool became filled with blood  and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery  With a little hard work  I see no reason why that can't happen to any of you  Are we done ? Can we go ?
label1 I didn't hog anything  Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it 
label2 Yeah  looks like there's a big storm all up the East Coast 
label1 Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat  It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order  In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce  They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash 
label1 Oh  dear Lord  shush 
label1 Much better than I expected  She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language  Watch  Welcome to my world  Not welcome to my world  Welcome  Not welcome 
label2 And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles ?
label1 More ? I mean  look at us  It's only been three years  here we are in bed together 
label1 The same thing I've been doing for three days  Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet 
label1 All right  I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday 
label1 Great  what is it ?
label2 I'm sorry  were you talking to me ?
label2 I call Frodo !
label1 A superb choice 
label2 Want me to make you some tea ?
label1 Because I knew you'd screw this up 
label2 Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both 
label1 Indeed  Yeah  at one point  Raj put on reggae music  and his sister took off her shoes  It was like the last days of Caligula 
label1 You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy ? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker  This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio 
label1 Wait  Is this really worth it ? We've lived together for years with nary an argument 
label1 Mm  Tough decision  There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings  forged in a Chinese sweatshop ?
label2 Oh  hey  Sheldon 
label1 Very well  You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake  presents and a shower of admiration and love  But then you owe me big-time 
label1 That's of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes 
label1 Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes 
label1 Now  how do you propose I get home ?
label2 That is a lovely story  um  are we going to do anything about Sheldon ?
label1 Not technically  In Hinduism  cattle are thought to be like God 
label1 Raj  don't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that 
label1 Oh  I wish it were that simple  You see  I don't spend much time here and so I've never really chosen a place to sit 
label2 No  I got you something for Valentine's Day  and I was too embarrassed to give it to you 
label2 Ah  you're upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough  and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields  and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day ?
label1 Oh  that's very kind of you  But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me  Let's go  Stuart 
label2 Bring a ball or a Frisbee  you know  something he can chase 
label1 What are you doing ? You have to start with the edges 
label2 Yeah  sure 
label2 Well  yeah  sex with you is pretty great  Have you ever tried it ?
label1 Okay  Um  what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics ?
label1 Godzilla clause ?
label2 Uh  if I still have them  they're probably in the junk box 
label2 Oh  why ? Do you not want to go ?
label1 Of course 
label1 Well  the evidence does support that 
label2 Putting it in my phone right now 
label2 Okay  we cannot leave this to chance  lets pick a girl  and figure out how to get her together with Dennis 
label2 Sure  sure  just I don't know much about football 
label1 I have a very wide circle  I have 212 friends on myspace 
label1 No  you didn't  But keep in mind  I felt extremely important 
label2 Wow  That  that's a big step 
label2 And their Sherpas 
label1 What a beautiful job Stephanie did  I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch  but you can't argue with her results  It's a shame it won't scar  the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity 
label1 May I have one of your fries ?
label1 I think you're just making that up 
label1 Yes  you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems  It used to be me  Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble  Anyway  I'm sorry for everything  Oh  and FYI  if you cry while they're fighting  they'll take you to McDonald's 
label2 I'm trying to think of an answer that won't stop you from doing this 
label2 I know  I know  look  you have a TV in your room  why don't you just have breakfast in bed ?
label1 Good one  And an electrical charge 
label1 We don't eat here  I don't know what's good 
label1 Hmm  Beats me  Now  I know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now 
label1 To paraphrase T  S  Eliot  this is the way the world ends  not with a bang but with a nephew 
label1 Well  this is me  It's been a very interesting evening 
label1 One of my best  don't you think ?
label1 Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard  I've had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ' 06 
label1 So  your project is more important than mine ?
label1 So it's settled  we're not doing it 
label1 It's not the first time  I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero  If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her  then I'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter 
label1 Why not ? It seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum 
label2 That is insane 
label2 Hippos are the deadliest creature  A half-human  half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass 
label1 Forget ! You want me to forget ? This mind does not forget  I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me  It was a drizzly Tuesday 
label2 Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys ?
label2 Man  I cannot catch a break 
label2 We could be betas  They're second in charge 
label1 Oh  I never identified with the rebel alliance  Despite their tendency to build Death Stars  I've always been more of an empire man 
label1 Well ? What do you think of New Comic Book Night ? Magic  huh ?
label2 You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me  You love me 
label1 I'll get them 
label1 First of all  you're welcome  And furthermore  not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work  there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure  Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so 
label2 With your career ?
label2 I'm not allergic to latex 
label2 Exactly  Right after they said yeah 
label1 Wait  I just want you all to know that I forgive you  This mutiny isn't your fault  it's mine  I haven't earned these bars  Although what I lack in leadership  apparently I more than make up for in sewing 
label1 No  I said there's nothing more important than me advancing science 
label1 But I designed it 
label2 Hey  what's going on with you ?
label1 Way ahead of you  that's an ' I Can't Believe It's Not Butter stick 
label1 My God ! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge ? Rocket scientist  how humiliating 
label1 She was old and blind  Leonard  What choice did we have ?
label2 Call me a lady part  We'll see about that 
label1 Thank you 
label1 You put me in charge of your finances  If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over  you should have asked Leonard 
label1 Are you sure ? Because your proposal suggests that you don't 
label2 No  no  friends forgive the little things 
label2 I never stopped hanging out with you 
label2 But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as  It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon 
label1 ldon : Cathedra mea  regulae meae  That's Latin for my chair  my rules  Now  you said on the phone that your area of study is physics 
label1 Those women are prostitutes ? You said they were raising money for stem cell research 
label1 Yeah  I'm afraid so  Childbirth  looming coitus ? This is a banner night for female genitals 
label2 Oh yeah  look at that 
label2 Sheldon  it's not a great time  what do you want ?
label1 Theoretical physicists do not get canned  But yeah 
label2 Really ? Any chance you find them cold  cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy ?
label1 And I appreciate the pretence 
label2 Well  now hold on  how about this ? How about we still hang out  but on the down-low ?
label1 Fourteen and a half 
label2 So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn't sleep on your couch ?
label1 I'm at a loss  If you like  you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there's a blunder I overlooked 
label1 Aah ! And after I let you be Gary 
label2 Oh  he's the Doppler Effect 
label2 I'm listening 
label2 Hmm ? Yeah ? What ? Huh ?
label2 So  what kind of things are they '
label1 Ooh  I don't think so  No  anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors  players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80 % of the time due to the limited number of outcomes  I suggest rock-paper-scissors - lizard-Spock 
label2 Problem ?
label1 Why ? Is there someone else ? Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bedpost  could you ?
label1 What exactly do you mean by that ?
label2 I think we have to acknowledge  those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews 
label2 Elegant 
label2 So you think it's fine if she works for Zack ?
label1 Why would you have surgery ?
label2 Well  maybe you can go at it from a different angle  like  um  you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine 
label1 Very well  a quick opening statement  Like a milking stool  my case rests on three legs  I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic  I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum  that which is necessary is legal  But first  I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue  I'm unable to confront my accuser  a non-human entity  to wit  a camera  So  to sum up  improper instruction  quod est necessarium est licitum  Sixth Amendment  My milk stool is complete 
label1 Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom  and then watched me roll right into traffic ?
label2 Sorry  Maybe next year  I'm just kidding  Romance ninja  Let's have sex  Waugh !
label1 No  he would be exactly the same 
label2 It would be a replica of a movie prop 
label1 You see where I'm going with this 
label2 Fine  Let's go  I think you'll find my work pretty interesting  I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians 
label2 You know  when you talk like that  I want to take you right here on this table 
label1 Oh  my  What an honour  Oh  this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods 
label2 Yes  Um  is this the High IQ sperm bank ?
label2 I'm sure Mrs  Florida's walking funny  Can we get back to work ?
label1 Yeah  that list is strong  Like your mother's urge to be promiscuous with sailors 
label2 No  they ended up calling me Sock Mouth  Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth 
label2 You mean  kiss you now ?
label2 Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed  It was weird 
label2 No  he lives here now 
label1 Well  that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page 
label1 My apologies Leonard  I'm only as good as my teacher 
label1 Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head ?
label2 The problem is  I want to be one of those guys 
label2 Yeah  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned 
label1 You think this is fast ? It's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower 
label2 Thanks  but we've got it covered 
label2 Uh  at least they're talking about the theory  I mean  that's what's important 
label1 I'm sorry 
label1 Yes  Lucky 
label2 I know  I feel so grown up 
label2 Oh  yeah  no  Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work  and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet 
label1 Superman doesn't sweat on Earth 
label1 Leonard  wait 
label1 I believe it's my turn  you may begin your questions whenever you're ready 
label1 Um Well You are black  right ?
label2 Pretty much  Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna 
label2 Well now you are 
label2 Why don't I just start ? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if  on a subconscious level  they don't feel they deserve them  Do you think maybe that's what's happening here ?
label1 Oh  that seems overly harsh  I mean  you gave in to a human weakness  you didn't kill a man  You know  it's a tad old-school  but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey 
label1 So as they say  all good things must come to an end 
label1 You know  right now  at the back of this line  there's a movie fan like you who's not going to get in  because this person simply doesn't care  Yeah  well  61 years ago  there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks 
label2 Yeah  me  too  I can't make up my mind 
label1 In my defence  I prefaced that by saying ' with all due respect  '
label2 Hey  Penny  this is Alicia  our new neighbour 
label2 No  if it's not a fact  it's not a fact 
label1 Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky 
label2 What's the matter ?
label2 Yeah  maybe  Open it first 
label2 Sheldon  it's not that bad 
label2 It's just a blackout  I'm sure the power will be back on soon 
label2 Well  he's a patent attorney  Maybe his tie is pending 
label1 Maybe we're better off  What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person ?
label2 I'm sorry 
label1 You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals ?
label2 Star Wars on Blu-ray 
label1 You look amazing  I mean  this resolution is remarkable 
label2 Can I help you ?
label1 Thank you  Amy  Here's your cat  And here's your $ 20 
label2 I'm okay  Just a little mouthwash  and then I'm gonna rock your world 
label2 Great  great  Did you walk the whole way ? It's a little chilly 
label1 Shall I come back at a better time ?
label2 You know this can go on all night  why don't you just come with us ?
label1 Oh  I know  I'm now an independent contractor 
label2 Unsweetened almond '
label1 It's not Elvish  It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script  One Ring to
label1 Hold on  Doctor  Leonard  where are your social skills ? This man is clearly upset  We should invite him in for a hot beverage 
label2 Are you sure that your being drunk  and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here ?
label1 She's right  I'm too hot 
label1 I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship 
label2 You're right  I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry  I'm way out of line !
label1 Oh  my  I've admired these for years 
label2 Buddy  I think Amy might be upset 
label1 He does that to me  too  Why do we put up with it ?
label2 You're kidding  You have your own book ?
label1 Oh ! There isn't enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart 
label2 Yeah  Raj  why ?
label2 Excuse me  could you help us out ?
label2 What is it ?
label1 And I'm glad you and I are friends again  too 
label2 Your attendance implies it's not 
label1 Of course  He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences  as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be 
label1 Uh  um  uh  thank you all so much for coming  Beverly  Wil Wheaton  Adam West  for some reason 
label2 Really  really bad 
label1 Thank you  Chocolate ?
label1 How could you do that ?
label2 That's fine  ' cause actually you're not invited 
label2 Howard  that's racist  any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick 
label2 No problem 
label2 It's the social protocol  it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at 
label2 Um  I don't know  maybe 
label2 Shut up  Howard  Sheldon  we have to do this 
label2 Oh  sounds great 
label1 Would it come with Kung-Fu grip ?
label1 Oh  really ? Well  how about now ?
label1 Thank you 
label1 I've been studying how to make people laugh  They say that comedy is tragedy plus time  Let's tickle some ribs 
label2 Listen  can I talk to you about your girlfriend ?
label1 Yeah  excuse me  Penny  but in this room  you're the one who's peculiar 
label2 It's actually a pretty simple process  You see  cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on '
label2 Very comforting  Okay  so what do I say to her ?
label2 How come you didn't tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce ? How come you didn't tell me you had surgery ? How come you didn't tell me my dog died ?
label2 Yeah  yeah  Uh  okay  You're a  you're a  you're a  a dirty  disgusting  revolting girl  Ugh !
label1 Apologize 
label1 It is just so frustrating 
label1 You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight 
label2 Hey  you guys want to go on a real live quest ?
label1 Thank you 
label1 I did a comprehensive background check  Medical records  credit reports  criminal history 
label1 Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced  not shredded ?
label2 Fine  you win  You're a bitch  Why couldn't we just have a nice time ?
label2 Well  of course I know why  But just for fun  why ?
label1 Can you believe this guy ?
label2 Yup  Got the code 
label1 Hang on  Voil '  the snowy tree cricket  aka Oecanthus fultoni  which is Latin for I'll suck nothing  Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo 
label1 No  wait  I need you to call Stan Lee  Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy  ' cause  legally  I'm not allowed to  Oh  and  also  Carrie Fisher  you know  ' cause I hear he can be pretty nuts 
label2 Thank you 
label1 Not for me  Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night  Tonight's selection  brussels sprouts 
label1 Well  just this once  you can count me as people  too 
label2 Why ? What happened ?
label2 I don't know  maybe that you'd be a little upset  and then you'd realize that I'm a stallion that has to run free  And that would turn you on a little 
label1 So  is that a yes ?
label2 Don't look up  there's cameras 
label1 People can't be in my bedroom 
label1 Well  she's due tomorrow  Although it did take her six years to finish high school  so who knows ?
label2 Morning 
label1 Well  I'll catch you up  Uh  Penny is angry at Leonard  Leonard's angry at me and Penny  I'm angry at Leonard and Amy  Raj is angry at Howard  and I'm angry at George R  R  Martin ' cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard 
label1 I don't understand what we're doing 
label2 I know  it's crazy  Welcome to the Thunderdome  people 
label2 It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing  I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not  Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him  he made me floss with my own shoelaces 
label1 You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre 
label2 I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you 
label1 Darn tootin '  I win 
label1 Would you like some aloe vera ? You just got burned  All right  my turn  Howard  Bernadette  Daq tu taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH 
label1 Interesting  Well  so I was right 
label2 What does that mean ?
label1 Penny  I'm a physicist  I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains 
label2 Good night 
label2 Why are you even part of this conversation ? You don't know anything about women 
label2 D-don't be silly  We're neighbours  we're going to run into each other  may as well get used to it 
label2 It's true  I did  I did say that  When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it 
label2 So  is it everything you hoped it would be ?
label1 I saw  And I just posted a retraction of my paper  Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong 
label1 Well  that's a fine how-do-you-do  Don't just stand there  Take your breasts out 
label2 Oh  hey  Dave  And Penny  what a surprise 
label2 Sheldon  I've known you a long time  and I'm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster  Amy's right  You're wrong 
label1 Oh  I hope so  What happened to you last night ?
label1 Of course they are  Leonard's being one 
label2 You're right  this side does look better 
label2 Just eat your tangerine chicken 
label1 Ah  what might have been  And you  give my regards to Barnum and Bailey 
label2 That's your system ?
label1 The skills are transferrable  I just have no interest in going in the water 
label1 Oh  you make me laugh  sad clown  Anyhoo  Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him  As he's been at sea  perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate 
label1 Use new eggs 
label2 Wait  we're gonna get married again ?
label1 We are ?
label2 This isn't so bad 
label1 It's a Pok'mon reference 
label2 Sheldon  you have to let somebody else answer 
label1 Isn't it five thirty in the morning there ?
label1 Will you please stop joking around ? I'm trying to figure this out 
label1 ldon : Correct  You've passed the first barrier to roommate-hood  You may enter 
label1 Great  New topic  Where are you in your menstrual cycle ?
label1 Do you want to come with me ?
label2 nard : Okay  I've had it with you  You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch  but this is applied physics  And when it comes to applied physic ' uh-oh 
label2 Well  I don't know how you have a relationship without talking 
label2 Suffered in silence ?
label1 Yes ma'am 
label2 Yeah  Okay  listen  If you're imagining that it was sexy  it wasn't  We  we were both drunk  and she smelled like an ashtray  The boat was moving a lot  so I chipped her tooth 
label1 I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card  You have any idea the kind of coupons I'm going to get in the mail now ?
label2 Oh  Watch out  Sheldon  This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost !
label2 What did Penny mean  you'd make a cute couple ?
label2 Sure  that's another way to go 
label1 Of course  She's spent many nights here  and you're worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding 
label1 I'll get the blankets  You Google how to have childlike fun 
label1 What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike ?
label2 You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you  It's exhausting 
label2 That is not fair  I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month 
label1 Again  not enough evidence  For all we know  he's being murdered  Now  back to our game 
label2 Hey  we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab 
label1 Hello  I'm Dr  Sheldon Cooper  Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags  My apologies that this episode is coming late  I did shoot one last week  in honour of Black History Month  but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist  My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community  who  like me  have been kept down by The Man  Now  Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado  it's also for the flag novice  so  to help me with that  please welcome my friend  neighbour  and flag virgin  yeah  not a real virgin  She's had coitus many times  Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast  Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles  Penny 
label1 I'm not crazy  My mother had me tested 
label1 I feel like I know what song that is  but I can't put my finger on it 
label1 This party is just going to suck 
label2 Excuse me  Is there anything you'd like to apologise for ?
label1 I think so 
label1 Detailed analysis posted online 
label2 I think we should be good neighbours  invite her over  make her feel welcome 
label1 Waltz  It's a social dance from Austria  choreographed to a three-four time signature 
label2 Oh  God  I wish I had 
label1 I see you're drinking wine 
label1 I don't need your help  Penny 
label1 In fact  you did  but I was referring to Howard 
label2 Really ?
label1 I thought I was getting better at it  but clearly I'm not 
label2 Okay  I don't get it  you said make an effort  here I am making an effort 
label2 I ' uh '
label2 That was really intense 
label2 In this case  you bet she is 
label2 Did ' okay  maybe ' some of it  but  look  the guy was just in the right place  at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe  He got lucky 
label1 Yes  That is the reason  My work is suffering because of all the laid I'm getting 
label1 Can you read them back ?
label1 You whistled ?
label2 I  I don't understand  All you've done since you discovered this stupid element was complain  I was trying to make you happy 
label2 You know  Penny  we make such a good team  maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime 
label1 I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom 
label2 You cannot exist as a virtual presence  Not here and certainly not at work  Oh  good God 
label2 No  he's fine  We just needed a little break 
label2 Yeah  Leonard Hofstadter  What happened ?
label2 Come on  help me out  Am I in trouble ?
label2 I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago  This is nice  I kind of wish no one else was coming 
label1 Well  once again  it's what I do 
label1 Okay  I have guests coming  I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now 
label1 Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning ?
label1 I don't make the rules  Leonard 
label1 Yeah  provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52  and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse 
label1 No  no  that's not mine  It has a big spot on it 
label1 What ? That's absurd  Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research 
label1 How does that work ?
label1 What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper ?
label1 What happened to the rest of your group ?
label1 All right  there's no need to bark at me  According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk  you'll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack  but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone  We have to fill these out  Describe illness or injury 
label2 Got it  All right  I'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process  is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names  Like S  Smith instead of Samantha Smith 
label2 It's a prop from a movie  and we're kind of fighting over it 
label1 Well  don't worry  He went to MIT  He can solve any problem  as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon 
label2 That's actually a valid example  Animals do deliver messages through scent 
label2 Why ? What's the problem ?
label1 The two of you need to get your women in line !
label1 We're all out of alcohol 
label2 Well  I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour 
label2 Hey  Sheldon  I was up in the administration office  and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science 
label1 We're going to the movies  What movie ? What theatre ? What time ? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you  you couldn't have done a better job 
label1 Only a suggestion  A catch in your throat would work just as well 
label2 Sheldon  that computer is used for National defence  Hacking into it is a Federal crime 
label1 Are you going to help me or not ?
label2 That is a lot of cologne 
label2 Hey  you can make jokes  but if this keeps up  he's gonna move back in here 
label1 Oh  then I'm out 
label2 I mean  I'm glad they're getting along  but it's starting to make me uncomfortable 
label1 Oh  good  I used that right  Anyway  you're aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component ?
label1 Well  a lot  it's very annoying  Has something changed ? Um  is there something that you're not telling me ?
label1 You're really going without me ?
label1 Ten seconds ago  you never heard of him  Now you're an expert 
label1 I may never stop thinking about it  Amy  what are the odds we run into this guy ?
label1 How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence ?
label1 Oh  clever ! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions 
label1 Oh  you brain monkeys kill me  Dip away 
label1 If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat  and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat  would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman ?
label2 You're nitpicking 
label1 I didn't invent them  they're there 
label2 Oh  right  your name  That makes more sense than penis 
label1 Ta-da !
label1 That's the great thing  It doesn't matter  My mind is freed up to think about more important things 
label1 Is there a ' check the check engine light light ' ?
label1 Very well  Can I ask you a question about women ?
label2 No  he's bluffing 
label2 Sheldon  just buy scalped tickets with us 
label1 It's right here on the bottom 
label2 Wow  No  it's great  Also  uh  mint in box 
label2 Oh yeah 
label2 Honey  you only had  like  three lines  That wasn't gonna happen anyway 
label1 Nice try  Now  Element Lad's ability is the power to transmute chemical elements  Helium has an atomic number of two  If you multiply that by the atomic number of N  nitrogen  you get 14  which is the atomic number of ? I'm just funnin you  silicon  And that is the most common element in the Earth's surface  So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab 
label2 May I ask why ?
label2 Penny  Penny  listen  I hope you're not doing this ' cause of you and me  because I have a girlfriend  and you're a single woman 
label2 Sure  maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death 
label1 Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from ? Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich  or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half ?
label2 Well  good for you  buddy  We'll let you get back in there 
label1 Why does Leonard get to go ?
label1 You know what  let me pull a quick contract off the Internet 
label1 I must admit  I can't help but feel a twinge of envy  He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes  His dim  uncomprehending eyes  It's like a cat in an airport carrying case 
label1 I can't tell you that  I am bound by closet organizer / organizee confidentiality 
label2 Ah  Well  thank you for your time 
label1 So there is the possibility  however remote  that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself 
label1 My pleasure  For a non-physicist  you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate 
label1 Well  everyone will think I'm weird 
label1 I guess this is it 
label1 Yeah  good for you  Leonard  That's a lovely little notion  Kind of like  I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago  Yeah  now stand back while I invent the telephone  Hello ? Oh  hold on  Leonard  it's your uncle  He says you just got burned 
label2 Hey  You ready to go ?
label2 Penny  come back  I'm sad for real now 
label1 But I think it would be comforting 
label1 I like a party as much as the next man  as long as the next man doesn't like a party  Oh  by the way  don't forget  tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting 
label1 Not really  But I'm mad at him  too  so lemon bars it is 
label2 No offence  Stuart  but the woman's a doctor 
label2 Sure  Dad 
label2 Yeah  well  she's not gonna be your wife for long 
label2 Gee  uh '
label1 Then  this is my first date 
label1 Oh  I overdid it myself last night  Hair of the dog 
label2 Good evening  ladies and gentlemen  My name is Dr  Leonard Hofstadter  and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science and my good friend  Dr  Sheldon Cooper  But before I do  I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother  who couldn't be here tonight  Isn't that nice ? His mother sent him a letter  She's proud of him  I wonder what that feels like  Dear Shelly  That's what she calls him  Shelly  it's a pet name  You know what my mother's pet name for me is ? Leonard  But I digress  Dear Shelly  I am so proud of '
label1 Kripke  Come in  I'm making tea  Would you like a cup ?
label2 Well  we're not in India 
label2 I don't care  I don't have to do anything you say because I don't think I want to live here anymore 
label1 Uh  a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells 
label1 Leonard moves the meeting not occur  Is there a second ? None heard  the motion fails  I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr  Stephanie 
label1 Oh  come on  Leonard ! This is obviously about Penny 
label2 What happened ?
label1 Okay  That was tricky  ' cause when it comes to alcohol  she generally means business 
label1 Go ahead 
label1 A common spare  The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant  Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment  watch how it's really done  I am the ball  My thoughts are its thoughts  Its holes are my holes 
label1 To the comic book store  You're probably thinking  the comic book store ? On a Thursday ? Why  I've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness  What you have failed to take into account  Penny  is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday 
label2 It's not hard  Just picture the Three Stooges  and then take away two stooges 
label2 We might be starting to zero in on your problem 
label1 Oh  please  I have ideas all day long  Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people  A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge  Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy  Why won't Doc prescribe him something ? We finally find out 
label1 There are takeout containers in the trash can 
label2 I think so 
label1 A naked man sat on it  Now  here's my concern  his diet is rich in fatty deli meats  What test do you have to detect lipid residue ?
label1 That's a fairly laboured metaphor  but I appreciate the sentiment behind it 
label2 To tell you the truth  I think we were both a little  I don't know '
label2 The Eta Meson 
label2 I saw a Thai place next door 
label2 What the hell is that 
label1 Good  Oh  FYI  After I eat my sandwich  I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite out for a test run  Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me ?
label2 No  no  no  I can do it 
label1 That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard 
label1 Yes  What  is there a problem ?
label2 What are we gonna tell the girls ?
label1 So  what are you in for ?
label2 Everything all right ?
label1 I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr  Seuss's death 
label1 I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here  Dr  Hofstadter  he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen  You know  and Howard Wolowitz  he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot  Oh  and at the office Christmas party  I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar 
label2 We're really sorry  It was an accident 
label2 I think this could be good for you  Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit 
label1 Yes  there are 
label2 Uh-huh  Look  Mrs  Fiona Fondell from Huntsville  Alabama has ordered two 
label1 It doesn't feel like an arm 
label2 Hey  Stuart  what's going on ?
label1 You could make it a train room 
label1 So they're both trying to make each other happy  and the end result is they make each other sad ? That's hilarious  I can't wait to tell them 
label1 You're not listening to my side of it 
label2 Sheldon 
label2 Where do you think I would take you ?
label2 Let's see  a lever  a lever 
label1 I found a hack online  I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS 
label2 Yeah  that's the only thing wrong with that plan 
label1 Apparently  you can't hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother 
label2 You know  I do have a way to get him out of our hair  I've been holding onto this for a few years  but maybe now's the time 
label1 I suppose that's acceptable 
label2 Why are you crouching there ?
label1 Sleepy kitty 
label2 Hey  buddy  you still looking for a place to live ?
label1 I wasn't speaking about me  I mean  honestly  there's no telling what will set you off  You know  introducing myself as your boyfriend  Giving you the opportunity to drive me home  Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour  the funniest kind of humour 
label2 I'm going to work  You can come if you want 
label2 Right  Be polite 
label2 Fine  bring us three orders of dumplings  that's twelve  we'll each have four 
label1 Oh  thank you  Mother 
label1 This isn't a desk  This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity 
label1 Okay  So  Feynman  Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar  Feynman says  it appears
label2 What's the big deal ? Raj bailed  so we could use some extra players 
label1 Who eats them horizontally ?
label1 You want me to remove him from the team ? I'm the captain  I can do that 
label1 You're welcome  And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant  Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting 
label2 She let me 
label1 He's trying to kill me  Leonard  Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence 
label1 No  wait  You have to drive me to work 
label2 Seriously ? You haven't used this desk in years  The second I want to get rid of it  you're up here working ?
label1 Well  I mean it  I'm really happy for you  And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial  Cheers 
label1 No  But I knew that his yay was sarcastic  Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof 
label2 He struck out 
label1 You know  I've always wanted to go to a goth nighclub 
label2 It was a late-night vote  We were all exhausted  and he was threatening to filibuster  It's not technically Road Trip God  it's Travel Supervisor 
label2 Okay  he gets how cool it is 
label2 Oh  hold on 
label2 Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change 
label1 Well  have a lovely evening 
label1 I just said that  This conversation has started to circle  Meeting adjourned 
label2 Well  too late  pal  I'm not going anywhere  Penny and I are very happy living together  Isn't that right ?
label1 I know  Go ahead  mock me  Just use small words so I understand 
label2 No  tell me 
label1 Absolutely not 
label2 It is  You just kind of put a damper on things when you said  the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death 
label2 Do you have a cousin Leopold 
label1 I have insufficient data to proceed  Excuse me  miss ?
label1 Hey  Los Angeles  I'm on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader  And he's nicer than you think 
label1 Fine  Okay  Now  on this side  I am closer to the exit in case of emergency 
label2 Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there ?
label1 Forgive me  as you know  I'm no adept at reading facial cues  but I'm going to take a stab here  you're either sad or nauseated 
label1 There's nothing to worry about  Your secret's safe with me 
label2 What ? Why ?
label1 Fine  How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century ? Hewlett and Packard  Dibs on Hewlett  What ? You want to be Hewlett ?
label1 Well  to be honest  I thought she said Yoda 
label1 Rabeliechtli  It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals  Which you will not be celebrating because  A  these festivals occur in the fall  and B  you will not be going to Switzerland
